1
00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.032
<i>- This whole thing is going to
be awesome, awesome, awesome.</i>

2
00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:16.134
I'm telling you,

3
00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.035
Operation: Thirty,
Flirty, and Thriving

4
00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:20.938
is going to be one memorable
shindig... I can feel it.

5
00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:22.247
- Yeah, and from
what you told me,

6
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:23.673
it sounds like it's going to be

7
00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:25.152
way better than the first
time Barry turned 30.

8
00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.077
- Oh, yeah, that time Team Flash

9
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:28.521
spent the whole night
fighting Cicada.

10
00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.181
- Well, thanks to
Dr. Orloff's gamma ray,

11
00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:31.748
Barry's got a
second crack at it,

12
00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:34.617
'cause on a cellular
level, he's still just 29.

13
00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.587
<i>Hey, what happened?</i>

14
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.156
<i>My readings are
saying that you're...</i>

15
00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:40.590
- Better than ever.

16
00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.591
- Okay, so as far as
everything else goes,

17
00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.360
I mean, I think we're good.

18
00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:46.039
Chester, you are still in
charge of entertainment.

19
00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:48.142
Allegra, you and I have already
done all the decorating.

20
00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:50.399
Khione is picking
up the cake, so...

21
00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:52.668
- Do you guys think he's
going to be surprised?

22
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:54.436
- He better be.

23
00:00:56.874 --> 00:01:00.076
- Okay, I just need
to grab my laptop.

24
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.612
Surprise!

25
00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:08.418
- Wally, Dig...

26
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.853
You guys got me.

27
00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:11.289
- Come here, man.

28
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.456
Happy birthday.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

29
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.457
- May your current
rotation around the sun

30
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.394
be your best yet.
- Okay.

31
00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:20.798
Thank you. Guys!

32
00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:46.224
- Yo, party people,
let's get wild!

33
00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:49.927
- It's got dried
sendru and honey.

34
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.063
It'll be good for your
morning sickness, I hope,

35
00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:53.662
and it tastes delicious.

36
00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.564
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers.

37
00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.001
- Mmm.
- Oh, yeah?

38
00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:58.578
- Barry, you have to try this.
- Oh, yeah?

39
00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:00.670
- Excuse us. Barry,
happy birthday.

40
00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.206
Can you settle something for us?

41
00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.640
- Sure.

42
00:02:03.673 --> 00:02:05.709
- See, I think I was
a better CCPD captain

43
00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:07.978
because I'm not a meta-human.
- Oh.

44
00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:09.379
- It keeps me objective.

45
00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:11.081
- Chief, having
meta-abilities gives me

46
00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:13.259
a better understanding of
what meta-criminals go through

47
00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:14.584
and how they're thinking.

48
00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:16.319
- Being human
implies I'm treating

49
00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:18.222
meta-criminals and
non-meta-criminals equally.

50
00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:20.456
- Actually, it implies
you're more biased

51
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.294
because non-metas set up the
system in the first place.

52
00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:25.062
What do you think?

53
00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:27.697
- Um, that...

54
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.868
Central City is lucky
to have you both.

55
00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:34.537
- Okay, okay, do you guys
mind if I borrow the man

56
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.671
of the hour for a moment?

57
00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:37.473
I have a special gift for him.

58
00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:39.911
How does it feel being

59
00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:41.443
- Unreal, I guess.

60
00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.223
- Because it's special,
Barry, which means it

61
00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:45.383
requires a special gift.

62
00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:48.085
- Dig, I...
- No, no, please, open it.

63
00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:56.360
- We thought we lost it
when Earth-38 was destroyed.

64
00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:58.295
But A.R.G.U.S. Found
it in National City.

65
00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:06.502
It's hard to believe it's
been three years, right?

66
00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:08.504
Sometimes I'll be at
the grocery store, man,

67
00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:11.342
or with my kids, and, uh...

68
00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:14.177
grief will hit me
all over again.

69
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.415
- Yeah.

70
00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:19.984
It's hard.

71
00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:23.287
We don't get the chance
to say goodbye to someone.

72
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.389
- I'm sorry to
hear about Caitlin,

73
00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:27.524
losing her so soon after Frost.

74
00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:29.794
- Eh, having Khione's helped.

75
00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:33.965
But something about it all
still just doesn't feel right.

76
00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:37.700
That's why I-I
can't accept this.

77
00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:40.003
- Barry, Oliver would have
wanted you to have this.

78
00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:41.471
- I'm sorry, Dig.

79
00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:45.675
Maybe we should just
display it in the hall.

80
00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:51.147
- Does Khione need
help with the cake?

81
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:52.960
- Oh, she said there's a
huge line at the bakery.

82
00:03:52.984 --> 00:03:55.585
So I figured, while
we're waiting,

83
00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:58.823
I might as well give you this.

84
00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.125
- You know it's not
my birthday, right?

85
00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.394
- It's just a little
something that I made you

86
00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:07.131
for our one-month anniversary.

87
00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.133
- It's beautiful.

88
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.768
- And it's not just for show.

89
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.003
I know you've been worried
about the "light meta" buzz,

90
00:04:13.037 --> 00:04:15.806
so I designed this to
conceal your identity.

91
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.574
It's got a facial
transmogrifier inside it.

92
00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:20.677
This way, you can
concentrate on using

93
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.980
all your powers to kick ass

94
00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:25.949
and not on trying
to hide your face.

95
00:04:25.983 --> 00:04:29.452
- Thanks. That'll
come in handy.

96
00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:31.653
- Plus, now got a
little piece of me

97
00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:34.391
keeping you safe out there.

98
00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:35.992
I love it.

99
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.762
And I love you, too.

100
00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.576
- ♪ Yo, I'll tell
you what I want ♪

101
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.435
♪ What I really, really want ♪

102
00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:47.480
- ♪ Yo, tell me what you want,
what you really, really want ♪

103
00:04:47.504 --> 00:04:49.548
- ♪ I'll tell you what I want,
what I really, really want ♪

104
00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:52.209
- ♪ Yo, tell me what you want,
what you really, really want ♪

105
00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:53.642
- That's a hit.

106
00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:55.478
♪ I wanna, I wanna, I wanna ♪

107
00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:57.747
- ♪ I wanna really, really,
really wanna zigazag, ah ♪

108
00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:00.517
- You know there's a whole party

109
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.454
going on in there, right?

110
00:05:03.487 --> 00:05:05.456
I just needed some air.
- Hmm.

111
00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:07.524
- Hey, thanks for coming
all the way for this.

112
00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:08.858
How are the Himalayas?

113
00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.028
- Well, Bakinimal has
been helping me a lot

114
00:05:11.062 --> 00:05:13.663
with my journey to
enlightenment, which is good.

115
00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:16.199
Um, but when Iris told
me about the Red Death,

116
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.600
it kind of gave me an idea.

117
00:05:17.634 --> 00:05:19.636
You know how I can
project my consciousness

118
00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:21.172
into the Speed Force?

119
00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:24.442
Well, I've been doing it to
find alternate timelines.

120
00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:25.708
- What for?

121
00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.019
- Since there are
other timelines,

122
00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:28.577
there's probably
another me out there

123
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.713
who has already
achieved enlightenment

124
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.749
and could help me find it, too.
- Wow.

125
00:05:32.783 --> 00:05:36.252
I mean, you already seem
so in touch with yourself.

126
00:05:36.286 --> 00:05:40.324
Can't you do it on your own?
- I wish it was that simple.

127
00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:43.894
Um, true awakening requires a
deep examination of the self.

128
00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.497
And when you have baggage
like I do, it's just...

129
00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.665
It can hold you back.

130
00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:50.800
- What baggage?

131
00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:53.636
I just... I thought the whole
point of you going to Tibet

132
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.473
was to deal with
things from your past.

133
00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.915
- Just forget it.

134
00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.119
Happy birthday.

135
00:06:12.523 --> 00:06:14.425
- Sparkling cider

136
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:15.925
for the hostess.
- Mm.

137
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.660
- Champagne for
the birthday boy.

138
00:06:17.694 --> 00:06:19.396
- Thank you.

139
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.574
- Okay, everybody, ting, ting,
ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.

140
00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:23.766
Please, raise a glass
for the birthday boy.

141
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.603
- Oh.
- Happy birthday.

142
00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:27.403
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday.

143
00:06:27.437 --> 00:06:28.805
- Happy birthday, Barry.
- Speech.

144
00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:31.208
- Speech.
- Speech, speech, speech.

145
00:06:31.242 --> 00:06:33.476
- I mean, what can I
say, except, um, I feel

146
00:06:33.511 --> 00:06:35.778
really lucky to have
the best friends

147
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.680
and family in the world.

148
00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:39.382
So here's to you guys.

149
00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:40.716
I love you all.

150
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.987
Cheers.
- Cheers.

151
00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:44.053
- Cheers.

152
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.060
- Chester, this cider
tastes a little expired.

153
00:06:50.093 --> 00:06:53.497
- It's not just the cider.
- I don't feel so good.

154
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:54.531
- Yeah, me neither.

155
00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:00.702
- Everybody stop drinking now.

156
00:07:00.737 --> 00:07:02.738
Iris, hey.

157
00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:11.214
- Barry, what is happening?

158
00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:13.750
<i>- Quite the
festivities, Mr. Allen.</i>

159
00:07:13.783 --> 00:07:17.120
<i>My invitation must have
been lost in the mail.</i>

160
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:30.500
I hope you don't mind
me crashing your party.

161
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.475
- Why all the sour faces?

162
00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:41.812
Don't tell me I've
missed the cake.

163
00:07:44.514 --> 00:07:45.882
- What did you do to them?

164
00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:48.017
- Is this how you
greet an old friend,

165
00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:50.420
especially one that's
just escaped A.R.G.U.S.?

166
00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:52.523
You know, I came right back here

167
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.290
so we could pick up
where we left off.

168
00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:56.961
And now I find out you're
having a party without me.

169
00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:58.862
- Look, I don't know you,

170
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:01.531
but I know that we can
solve this without violence.

171
00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.800
- Mr. West...

172
00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.168
I don't want violence.

173
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:06.937
I simply wish to save the world.

174
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:08.639
- You don't want to save anyone.

175
00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:10.874
You're a monster who
wants to absorb us all

176
00:08:10.908 --> 00:08:12.509
into your sick mind.

177
00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:15.245
- Is that such an unfair
price to pay for immortality?

178
00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:18.214
- You hurt Iris, I will wipe
every last one of your cells

179
00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:19.315
off this planet.

180
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.750
- Fear not.

181
00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:22.552
Your wife is perfectly
safe and healthy,

182
00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:24.387
and she'll stay
that way forever,

183
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.257
which means your daughter will
never know an orphan's grief.

184
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.627
On the contrary,
little Nora West-Allen

185
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.896
would be the first blood baby
born into a whole new world.

186
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.135
Your anger means nothing, Barry.

187
00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:41.572
Now, last time, I made you
into a blood brother first,

188
00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:44.441
only for your meddlesome
team to rise up against me.

189
00:08:44.475 --> 00:08:47.144
But this time, they
won't have that chance.

190
00:08:47.177 --> 00:08:50.581
And soon, your meager healing
factors will run out, too.

191
00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:52.383
- I don't know
what you're up to,

192
00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:55.686
but you're not going to
get into my head again.

193
00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:58.187
- But, Barry...

194
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.759
I already am.

195
00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:23.013
Time to begin the good work.

196
00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:26.984
Someone didn't drink
their champagne.

197
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:31.688
- Uh, bro, I'm not
really much of a drinker.

198
00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:33.157
- That's no fun.

199
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.591
Now I'm going to have to
bring the party to you.

200
00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:44.802
- Sweet Duane Jones.

201
00:09:47.538 --> 00:09:50.874
Oh, no, frak this.

202
00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:57.181
- How fascinating.

203
00:09:57.214 --> 00:10:01.150
You're sharing your oxygen
with the embryo inside you.

204
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:04.455
And she's sharing her
healing factors with you.

205
00:10:04.488 --> 00:10:07.191
- We're going to stop you.
- No, you won't.

206
00:10:07.224 --> 00:10:10.828
I've been playing the
long game, and you...

207
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.863
have already lost.

208
00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.101
- Ramsey!

209
00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:21.938
I know you can hear me!

210
00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.140
You can't fool me again.

211
00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:26.009
Those visions you
showed me last time,

212
00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:28.611
they were lies,
made to tempt me!

213
00:10:28.644 --> 00:10:31.850
- I never lied to you, Barry.

214
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.585
I just showed you
a future where you

215
00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:37.019
had the power to end death.

216
00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.791
But you rejected my offer.

217
00:10:39.823 --> 00:10:44.027
And now your friends
are dropping like flies.

218
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:48.097
Nash, Caitlin, Frost...
It's quite the list.

219
00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:51.467
- You can't break me again.
- I don't need to, Barry.

220
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:55.038
This time I have a more
interesting target in mind,

221
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:59.878
just as fleet-footed,
too, only more perceptive.

222
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.779
- Wally.

223
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:09.186
- Wally.

224
00:11:09.219 --> 00:11:10.453
Son.

225
00:11:10.486 --> 00:11:12.722
Wally?

226
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:16.427
<i>Mama needs her medicine.</i>

227
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.631
<i>Wally!</i>

228
00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:25.001
<i>Mama needs her
medicine. Wally...</i>

229
00:11:25.034 --> 00:11:27.070
- I'm sorry, Mr. West.

230
00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:29.440
I thought seeing your childhood
home would be comforting,

231
00:11:29.472 --> 00:11:33.243
but I suppose it
is rather spartan,

232
00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:36.580
especially compared to Barry's.

233
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.315
- Why'd you bring me here?

234
00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:40.417
- Because you need
a friend, Wallace,

235
00:11:40.451 --> 00:11:42.418
and because we can
help each other.

236
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.788
- I'd never help you.

237
00:11:43.822 --> 00:11:45.655
- But you already have.

238
00:11:45.688 --> 00:11:48.225
You see, the last time I
encountered Team Flash,

239
00:11:48.258 --> 00:11:50.259
when I possessed Barry's mind,

240
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.931
I learned what was coming...

241
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:57.802
A crisis to end the Multiverse.

242
00:11:57.836 --> 00:11:59.937
But I guess it didn't take.

243
00:12:07.711 --> 00:12:09.245
- No, you're wrong.

244
00:12:09.278 --> 00:12:11.981
The Multiverse is dead.

245
00:12:12.014 --> 00:12:14.585
I know because I lost Jesse.

246
00:12:16.788 --> 00:12:18.856
She's never coming back.

247
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:20.323
- Tell me something, Wallace.

248
00:12:20.356 --> 00:12:22.326
What did you see
out there when you

249
00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:24.160
projected your consciousness...

250
00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:26.965
Alternate timelines...

251
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.432
or other Earths?

252
00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:31.735
Yes, Wallace, you
can sense them.

253
00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:34.437
So isn't it possible that
there's another Jesse Quick

254
00:12:34.471 --> 00:12:36.606
out there somewhere just waiting

255
00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:39.208
for her Prince Charming
to come and find her?

256
00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:42.513
- You're trying to trick me,

257
00:12:42.546 --> 00:12:45.448
but you can't tempt me
with simple desires.

258
00:12:45.481 --> 00:12:47.183
I know my truth.

259
00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:50.386
- And why have you failed in
your quest for enlightenment?

260
00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:53.991
I know you've been wrestling
with the darkness inside you

261
00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:57.059
and how desperate you are
to rid yourself of it.

262
00:12:57.094 --> 00:13:00.697
But you can't, not on your own.

263
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.065
Let me help you.

264
00:13:02.099 --> 00:13:04.534
- How, by turning
me into a zombie?

265
00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:09.006
- No, by unlocking
your true potential.

266
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.210
<i>This is your future,
Wally West.</i>

267
00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:15.611
You will enlighten
the entire world

268
00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:18.749
<i>and all the other worlds
yet to be discovered.</i>

269
00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:27.256
All you have to
do is choose life.

270
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:30.861
- No, y-you turned everybody
I loved into your slave.

271
00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.361
That's not choice.

272
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.530
- I understand your hesitation.

273
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:37.634
No one has ever really
believed in you, have they?

274
00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:40.303
You have been cut
down your entire life,

275
00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:44.073
forced to watch
your mother suffer.

276
00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:47.744
It is a pain that I
know all too well.

277
00:13:49.947 --> 00:13:52.917
My mother was
diagnosed with HLH,

278
00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:55.953
and I couldn't save
her either, Wally.

279
00:13:55.986 --> 00:13:58.889
I had to watch her die.

280
00:13:58.923 --> 00:14:00.724
- And we have that in common.

281
00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:04.461
- Then you understand what it
is that I'm trying to do...

282
00:14:04.494 --> 00:14:06.296
That it's about more
than just stopping death.

283
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.966
It is about ending the suffering

284
00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:12.003
that we have both endured,
that, together, we can create

285
00:14:12.035 --> 00:14:14.772
a Multiverse where
no one has to watch

286
00:14:14.806 --> 00:14:17.607
their loved ones die...

287
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.176
ever again.

288
00:14:25.716 --> 00:14:28.552
- Okay, okay, just me.

289
00:14:28.585 --> 00:14:31.022
Okay, all your
friends are zombies.

290
00:14:31.054 --> 00:14:33.389
But it's, uh... it's
okay. It's okay.

291
00:14:33.423 --> 00:14:36.326
You just got to call for help.

292
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.595
<i>- Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

293
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:39.897
- Iris?

294
00:14:39.931 --> 00:14:41.465
Oh, I thought you were a zombie.

295
00:14:41.498 --> 00:14:43.600
<i>- Little Nora's
healing factor...</i>

296
00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:46.602
<i>I-it's holding off
the infection for now.</i>

297
00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.605
<i>Look, I locked myself
in a time vault,</i>

298
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:52.844
<i>but someone cut the power
to the outside comms.</i>

299
00:14:52.876 --> 00:14:54.144
- Iris?

300
00:14:54.177 --> 00:14:56.178
Iris, can you hear me?

301
00:14:56.212 --> 00:14:58.414
- I've been waiting
for you, Chuck.

302
00:14:58.447 --> 00:15:02.485
What, don't you want to
give your lover a kiss?

303
00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:05.355
- No, no, no, no.
You're not Allegra.

304
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:08.191
You're Ramsey
controlling her body.

305
00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:11.028
- And what a
powerful body it is.

306
00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:12.663
- Doing this to
people ain't a gift.

307
00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:15.499
- What else would you
call eternal life?

308
00:15:15.532 --> 00:15:17.167
- I'd call it hell on Earth.

309
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.971
- You know what?
I'll leave you alone.

310
00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:28.779
Unfortunately, the rest
of my brothers and sisters

311
00:15:28.812 --> 00:15:30.447
have different plans.

312
00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.686
- Leave Wally alone.

313
00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:37.220
- Don't worry.

314
00:15:37.254 --> 00:15:39.188
I have no intention
of harming him.

315
00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:42.092
But if I did, it
would be just one more

316
00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:44.193
sacrifice in your name, right?

317
00:15:44.226 --> 00:15:46.663
Sorry.

318
00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:51.268
Is it me, or is the lighting
in here a tad too melodramatic?

319
00:15:51.301 --> 00:15:54.705
Can I get a grip or an
electrician over here?

320
00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:59.177
- What the hell? Where are we?

321
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.544
- Language, Barry,
it's a family show.

322
00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:03.722
Now you'll have to keep up if
we're going to make our day.

323
00:16:03.746 --> 00:16:06.149
After all, you're
the star of the show.

324
00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:15.424
- Wait, what's...
What's happening?

325
00:16:15.458 --> 00:16:17.761
- Okay, ready to try one?
- What is this?

326
00:16:17.794 --> 00:16:18.895
What are you doing?

327
00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:20.429
- Making you look good, champ.

328
00:16:20.464 --> 00:16:23.134
All right, lock it up.

329
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.107
- Hey, man, love your work.

330
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.909
Roll sound.

331
00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.048
- Mark.

332
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:39.817
- Ready, and action.

333
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.057
- Um...

334
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.192
Hi, kids.

335
00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:51.062
I'm the Flash.

336
00:16:51.095 --> 00:16:53.029
Did you know that
when a person survives

337
00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:56.067
an event that others didn't,

338
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.235
it can lead to...

339
00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:59.836
feelings of guilt?

340
00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:04.307
That's a Flash fact.

341
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.577
No, I'm not... I'm
not doing this.

342
00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:11.249
- Cut. That's a cut, everyone.

343
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.185
- Frost.

344
00:17:18.088 --> 00:17:20.023
- It's okay that
she's dead, Barry.

345
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:24.461
It's more important
that you live.

346
00:17:24.493 --> 00:17:26.029
You're the star, right?

347
00:17:26.063 --> 00:17:28.365
- No. No, that's not true.

348
00:17:28.397 --> 00:17:30.432
- You matter more
than the rest of us.

349
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:31.903
That's why it's okay

350
00:17:31.935 --> 00:17:33.904
that you got those extra
years and we didn't.

351
00:17:33.938 --> 00:17:36.807
- I didn't want extra time,
not without all of you.

352
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.910
- Oh, that's lunch.

353
00:17:47.884 --> 00:17:50.988
- Wally...

354
00:17:51.021 --> 00:17:53.191
are you okay?

355
00:17:53.223 --> 00:17:55.659
- Young Wallace is
better than ever.

356
00:17:55.692 --> 00:18:00.298
He and I had a very
enlightening conversation.

357
00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.866
- Listen to me, Wally.

358
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.038
Whatever Ramsey showed
you, it's not real.

359
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.839
- Shut up, Barry.

360
00:18:08.873 --> 00:18:09.941
Just shut up.

361
00:18:09.973 --> 00:18:12.541
- This anger isn't you.

362
00:18:12.576 --> 00:18:16.314
Ramsey's manipulating you, so
you'll choose to follow him.

363
00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:18.915
It's the only way he can
beat our speed healing

364
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.317
and take over our minds.

365
00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.019
- He doesn't care
about you, Wallace.

366
00:18:22.053 --> 00:18:25.588
He's been living with your
father, pawing at your sister,

367
00:18:25.622 --> 00:18:28.025
while you were trapped
in that hellhole.

368
00:18:28.058 --> 00:18:29.794
- You were living my life.

369
00:18:29.826 --> 00:18:33.430
- Wally, I know how hard
it was for you growing up.

370
00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:36.099
- No, you don't! You
don't know anything!

371
00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:37.944
- But Joe and Iris didn't
even know that you existed.

372
00:18:37.969 --> 00:18:41.503
- Keep his name out your mouth.
Joe West is my dad, mine.

373
00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:42.807
He's not yours.

374
00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:44.942
But you stole him
anyway from me.

375
00:18:44.976 --> 00:18:47.443
You got to have two
dads who loved you.

376
00:18:47.477 --> 00:18:49.113
I had nobody, Barry.

377
00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:52.115
You're so selfish.

378
00:18:52.148 --> 00:18:54.285
And you know why?

379
00:18:54.317 --> 00:18:58.387
Because you think that you're
the only person that matters.

380
00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:00.723
- Wally...

381
00:19:00.757 --> 00:19:02.960
Joe loves you.

382
00:19:02.993 --> 00:19:05.061
And I love you.

383
00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:13.203
- Well, I hate you.

384
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.441
- Yes!

385
00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:49.571
- Oh, Barry, Barry, Barry...

386
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.808
what have you done this time?

387
00:20:01.384 --> 00:20:03.119
- No.

388
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:07.357
No, Ramsey's still
messing with my head.

389
00:20:07.391 --> 00:20:09.625
- Barry, you need to calm down.

390
00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:11.895
- You're not real.

391
00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:13.431
How did I get here?

392
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:16.133
Wally, he was a blood
brother. He attacked me.

393
00:20:20.502 --> 00:20:22.239
He killed me.

394
00:20:22.272 --> 00:20:25.041
- Dying is the easy part.

395
00:20:25.076 --> 00:20:26.509
Remember?

396
00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:30.948
- It's really you.
- Yeah.

397
00:20:32.682 --> 00:20:35.751
Okay. Okay.

398
00:20:35.786 --> 00:20:37.020
Okay.

399
00:20:37.054 --> 00:20:38.888
Okay, let go.

400
00:20:38.923 --> 00:20:40.223
Barry, let go.

401
00:20:40.257 --> 00:20:43.326
- Wait. If you're here,
that means I'm really...

402
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:44.894
- You're dead.

403
00:20:44.929 --> 00:20:47.464
Otherwise, why would I
let you hug me that long?

404
00:20:50.633 --> 00:20:53.770
- But if I'm dead, no
one's there to stop them.

405
00:20:53.804 --> 00:20:57.307
Iris, the baby, the... The
whole world is in danger.

406
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.808
- I know.

407
00:20:58.843 --> 00:21:01.945
But it's not just your
world that's in danger.

408
00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:05.082
When I took on the
power of the Spectre,

409
00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:08.451
I thought that I was simply
creating Earth-Prime.

410
00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:11.788
But I was also making
something else...

411
00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:14.590
A new Multiverse to replace
the one that had fallen.

412
00:21:16.861 --> 00:21:18.496
- But when we fought
the Red Death,

413
00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.007
she thought she escaped
from her timeline

414
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.767
into an alternate one.
- She is from Earth-4125.

415
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:24.335
- You're numbering them?

416
00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.836
- I've had a bit of
time on my hands...

417
00:21:26.871 --> 00:21:29.874
Keeping an eye on threats
to these new worlds,

418
00:21:29.906 --> 00:21:32.942
like your friend Ramsey Rosso.

419
00:21:32.977 --> 00:21:34.811
He wants to spread
his infectious cells

420
00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:36.814
to every world out there.

421
00:21:36.846 --> 00:21:38.782
- No, I mean, Ramsey's powerful,

422
00:21:38.816 --> 00:21:40.851
but he's not capable
of something like that.

423
00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:44.020
- Right, but with
Wally by his side...

424
00:21:44.055 --> 00:21:47.290
Wally thought that he was
projecting his consciousness

425
00:21:47.324 --> 00:21:50.528
into the Speed Force to
reach alternate timelines,

426
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:54.464
when, in fact, he was
reaching other Earths.

427
00:21:54.498 --> 00:21:57.535
So, if Ramsey's control

428
00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.471
over Wally becomes permanent...

429
00:22:00.503 --> 00:22:03.074
- He'll gain control
over the Multiverse, too.

430
00:22:08.846 --> 00:22:11.848
Now, what have we here?

431
00:22:11.882 --> 00:22:15.986
Ah, a gift from the boy genius.

432
00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:18.189
You were so worried about
Allegra's protection,

433
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:20.391
you didn't stop and
think about your own.

434
00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:23.894
Don't worry.

435
00:22:23.928 --> 00:22:25.627
In a few moments,
you won't care.

436
00:22:35.205 --> 00:22:36.874
- Sounds like trouble.

437
00:22:36.906 --> 00:22:39.375
- No.

438
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.510
- Khione?

439
00:22:47.484 --> 00:22:49.185
Whoa.

440
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.823
What'd you, uh...
what'd you do to her?

441
00:22:52.856 --> 00:22:54.858
- Same thing I did to
everyone else out there.

442
00:22:54.892 --> 00:22:56.926
I froze all the
water in her body.

443
00:22:56.961 --> 00:22:59.695
Oh, don't worry. She's safe.

444
00:22:59.729 --> 00:23:01.698
- Wait. How did you
know to find me here?

445
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.700
- I was in line
waiting for the cake

446
00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:06.903
when I felt a
presence calling me,

447
00:23:06.936 --> 00:23:09.940
telling me that I
was needed here.

448
00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:12.709
Only, now I get the
feeling the job isn't done.

449
00:23:22.519 --> 00:23:24.686
- This world will be cured soon.

450
00:23:24.721 --> 00:23:28.592
But there are so many
other worlds out there.

451
00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:30.560
I think it's time we started.

452
00:23:48.378 --> 00:23:50.647
- Feel them...

453
00:23:50.712 --> 00:23:55.318
millions of worlds waiting
for your life blood.

454
00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:58.221
- A gateway to the Multiverse.

455
00:23:58.255 --> 00:23:59.990
Thank you, brother.

456
00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:05.095
Now infinite souls will
know my gift and rejoice.

457
00:24:24.013 --> 00:24:26.584
- The attack's starting.

458
00:24:26.616 --> 00:24:28.551
Ramsey's fed his
cells into the breach.

459
00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:30.653
Soon, they are going
to infect your world

460
00:24:30.688 --> 00:24:32.423
and all of the worlds
yet to be born.

461
00:24:32.455 --> 00:24:35.792
- I have to stop him. You
have to get me out of here.

462
00:24:35.826 --> 00:24:38.862
- It's not that simple.
- You have the power of a god.

463
00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:40.597
You can bring me
back from the dead.

464
00:24:40.631 --> 00:24:42.532
- No, I can't...

465
00:24:42.566 --> 00:24:46.036
not while there is a part of you

466
00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:49.405
that doesn't want to go back.

467
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.709
- That's not true.

468
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.742
- You've always been
a terrible liar.

469
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.919
It's...

470
00:25:01.951 --> 00:25:05.722
it's my birthday today.

471
00:25:05.755 --> 00:25:06.923
I didn't want to do anything,

472
00:25:06.957 --> 00:25:09.226
but Iris threw
this party, and...

473
00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:13.696
I-I should have been
grateful, happy.

474
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.099
But all I could
think about was...

475
00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:19.836
Everyone who couldn't be there.

476
00:25:19.869 --> 00:25:21.904
- You've lost a lot
of people this year.

477
00:25:21.939 --> 00:25:24.642
- Yeah, Frost died
fighting Deathstorm.

478
00:25:24.674 --> 00:25:26.844
Caitlin died trying to save her.

479
00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:29.046
I fight some random
mad scientist.

480
00:25:29.078 --> 00:25:31.749
I get three extra years to live.

481
00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:34.250
You know everything
now, right, Oliver?

482
00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:39.455
Tell me, how is it right
I'm alive and they're dead?

483
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.691
How's that fair?

484
00:25:40.723 --> 00:25:43.460
- Life is a lot
of things, Barry.

485
00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:44.928
Fair isn't on the list.

486
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:47.364
- You don't really believe that.

487
00:25:47.397 --> 00:25:50.334
And if you did, your mom
wouldn't be alive again...

488
00:25:50.366 --> 00:25:51.934
or Tommy or Lance.

489
00:25:51.969 --> 00:25:56.272
You used your powers to bring
back everyone you loved.

490
00:25:56.307 --> 00:25:58.608
- Not everyone.

491
00:25:58.642 --> 00:26:00.109
- Your dad.

492
00:26:00.144 --> 00:26:01.711
- Survive.

493
00:26:01.744 --> 00:26:04.414
- No!

494
00:26:04.448 --> 00:26:08.618
- Ollie, I'm sorry.
- It's... it's okay.

495
00:26:08.652 --> 00:26:10.119
Bringing him back
would have done

496
00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:13.490
too much to alter reality.

497
00:26:13.523 --> 00:26:16.926
And I'd already done enough
to dishonor his sacrifice.

498
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.195
When my father
sacrificed himself,

499
00:26:19.229 --> 00:26:22.499
when he gave me my extra years,

500
00:26:22.532 --> 00:26:25.736
what was I doing with them?

501
00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:27.337
I was wasting them.

502
00:26:27.371 --> 00:26:30.641
I was drowning
myself in this sea

503
00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:33.811
of... of pain and darkness

504
00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:35.814
and saying, Ollie,
if you just...

505
00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:39.784
If you cross one more
name off the list,

506
00:26:39.817 --> 00:26:44.020
if you save your
city one more time,

507
00:26:44.054 --> 00:26:46.923
then you'll absolve yourself
of all of this guilt.

508
00:26:46.957 --> 00:26:48.659
And I was wrong.

509
00:26:50.795 --> 00:26:53.329
This guilt is never
going to go away.

510
00:26:53.364 --> 00:26:56.467
It is something that you
have to learn to live with.

511
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.369
That is why people
sacrificed themselves.

512
00:26:59.403 --> 00:27:02.740
That is why I sacrificed
myself for you,

513
00:27:02.773 --> 00:27:06.676
so that in all of
this darkness...

514
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.378
you...

515
00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:12.548
Could be a guiding light...

516
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:18.020
A hero.

517
00:27:18.055 --> 00:27:19.790
- Because heroes
don't stop running.

518
00:27:19.824 --> 00:27:21.392
- You're damn right.

519
00:27:21.424 --> 00:27:24.193
So...

520
00:27:24.228 --> 00:27:26.630
are you ready to keep running?

521
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.269
Good.

522
00:27:32.301 --> 00:27:34.570
- Wait, hang on.
You're not going to...

523
00:27:34.605 --> 00:27:35.972
boop me again, are you?

524
00:27:36.006 --> 00:27:38.208
It kind of killed the
Speed Force last time.

525
00:27:38.241 --> 00:27:41.644
- No, no, I'm not gonna...
Not gonna boop you.

526
00:27:43.614 --> 00:27:45.082
- Ow!

527
00:27:45.115 --> 00:27:47.917
That hurts.
- Living hurts.

528
00:27:51.521 --> 00:27:52.689
Add it to the list.

529
00:27:52.722 --> 00:27:54.758
- Wait. You came back, too.

530
00:27:54.792 --> 00:27:56.326
- It's just temporary.

531
00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:58.961
I can only intervene when
the Multiverse is in danger.

532
00:27:58.996 --> 00:28:00.798
- I think you missed me.

533
00:28:05.102 --> 00:28:09.840
- Not as much as I missed this.

534
00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:13.912
Let's go kick some ass.

535
00:28:24.855 --> 00:28:26.825
- Ramsey's cells
are metastasizing

536
00:28:26.857 --> 00:28:28.125
inside that breach.

537
00:28:28.157 --> 00:28:29.692
If we're going to wipe them out,

538
00:28:29.726 --> 00:28:31.627
we need a massive
ultraviolet pulse.

539
00:28:38.469 --> 00:28:41.538
How'd he do that? I thought
you were the Spectre.

540
00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:44.974
- The attack on the Multiverse
is weakening my powers.

541
00:28:45.008 --> 00:28:47.912
I need a clear
shot at the breach.

542
00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:51.181
- The Flash and Green
Arrow together again?

543
00:28:51.214 --> 00:28:53.785
I am honored.
- Don't be.

544
00:28:53.817 --> 00:28:56.353
- Wally, you don't
have to do this.

545
00:28:56.385 --> 00:28:58.020
Too late, Flash.

546
00:28:58.055 --> 00:29:00.791
Wallace worships
a new faith now.

547
00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:04.361
He worships at the
altar of Bloodwork.

548
00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:12.669
- You are starting
to piss me off.

549
00:29:12.702 --> 00:29:14.403
- Why?

550
00:29:14.438 --> 00:29:17.039
I'm only trying to improve your
Multiverse by ending death.

551
00:29:17.074 --> 00:29:19.542
Then I can bring
every world together

552
00:29:19.576 --> 00:29:21.813
under one mind for
singular purpose...

553
00:29:21.846 --> 00:29:23.513
Immortality.

554
00:29:23.547 --> 00:29:26.984
- Those worlds
don't belong to you.

555
00:29:27.017 --> 00:29:28.819
- You're right.

556
00:29:28.853 --> 00:29:30.954
They belong to them.

557
00:30:32.115 --> 00:30:35.719
- Are you, uh... are you
sure this is going to work?

558
00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:37.055
- Trust me.

559
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.531
- That's all I can manage.

560
00:30:48.565 --> 00:30:51.035
- Oh! Aah!

561
00:30:55.873 --> 00:30:57.708
Mm.

562
00:31:00.044 --> 00:31:02.679
What the hell?

563
00:31:02.712 --> 00:31:05.214
Did that come out of me?

564
00:31:05.248 --> 00:31:08.151
Where's Barry?
- He needs your help.

565
00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:42.987
- I'm not going to
fight you, Wally.

566
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.288
Wallace is gone.

567
00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:47.791
- I know you can hear me.

568
00:31:47.825 --> 00:31:51.128
I need you to know I'm sorry,

569
00:31:51.161 --> 00:31:52.864
not just for today,

570
00:31:52.896 --> 00:31:55.833
for all the times I've made you
feel like you didn't matter.

571
00:31:57.366 --> 00:32:01.238
- Everyone has
darkness inside them.

572
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.574
There is no cure for that
pain. We can only accept it.

573
00:32:04.607 --> 00:32:06.710
That's the only
way we can beat it.

574
00:32:06.742 --> 00:32:10.080
You can do this, Wally.
You can beat him.

575
00:32:10.114 --> 00:32:12.983
I know you can!
- No!

576
00:32:16.318 --> 00:32:18.587
- Brother/sister
crime-fighting unit.

577
00:32:18.622 --> 00:32:20.791
No.

578
00:32:20.825 --> 00:32:23.060
No!

579
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:34.738
- I killed you. I'm sorry.

580
00:32:34.771 --> 00:32:36.173
- I came back.

581
00:32:38.575 --> 00:32:41.711
Now let's go save
the Multiverse.

582
00:32:52.155 --> 00:32:54.657
- Impressive...

583
00:32:54.691 --> 00:32:57.594
but let's see how
you fare against me.

584
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.208
- Oliver.

585
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.044
- I can explain.

586
00:33:13.076 --> 00:33:15.078
- It doesn't matter, man.

587
00:33:20.416 --> 00:33:22.384
- How touching.

588
00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:25.622
Unfortunately, this reunion
will be short-lived.

589
00:33:28.592 --> 00:33:30.559
- That's one ugly
son of a bitch.

590
00:33:55.751 --> 00:33:58.320
- Oliver, we got
you a clear shot.

591
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:04.261
- Ramsey Rosso!

592
00:34:04.294 --> 00:34:07.265
You have failed this city!

593
00:34:32.655 --> 00:34:36.126
+
- I feel like I just recovered

594
00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.829
from the world's worst hangover.

595
00:34:38.862 --> 00:34:40.429
- I think we all did.

596
00:34:40.463 --> 00:34:42.699
- The last thing I remember
is drinking champagne.

597
00:34:42.731 --> 00:34:43.768
What happened?

598
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.103
- Ramsey's having
a very bad day.

599
00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:49.139
- Hey, what about Allegra?

600
00:34:49.172 --> 00:34:51.074
- Chuck.

601
00:35:05.722 --> 00:35:08.159
- What have you done to me?

602
00:35:08.192 --> 00:35:09.693
I'm human again.

603
00:35:09.726 --> 00:35:11.896
- I've cleansed the
entire Multiverse

604
00:35:11.929 --> 00:35:13.164
of your infectious cells.

605
00:35:13.197 --> 00:35:14.965
- including the ones inside you.

606
00:35:14.998 --> 00:35:16.565
- And you killed me.

607
00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:18.534
Now my HLH will return.

608
00:35:18.568 --> 00:35:21.838
- I took care of that, too...
Perks of being the Spectre.

609
00:35:21.873 --> 00:35:23.639
- So it looks like
you'll be spending

610
00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:26.010
the rest of your human
days as a regular criminal.

611
00:35:26.043 --> 00:35:28.445
- Where you're going
to rot until old age,

612
00:35:28.478 --> 00:35:30.646
just like everyone else.

613
00:35:30.679 --> 00:35:32.481
- No.

614
00:35:32.514 --> 00:35:35.684
I was going to cure death.

615
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:38.054
I was supposed to
save the world.

616
00:35:38.088 --> 00:35:41.259
- Don't worry.
That's our job.

617
00:35:48.498 --> 00:35:50.210
- Thank you so much for
protecting my family.

618
00:35:50.233 --> 00:35:51.534
I don't know how much longer

619
00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:54.105
little Nora and I
could have held out.

620
00:35:54.137 --> 00:35:55.505
- Well, you're welcome.

621
00:35:55.538 --> 00:35:58.641
- I still can't believe
that you're here.

622
00:35:58.675 --> 00:36:00.143
- I'm only allowed to intervene

623
00:36:00.177 --> 00:36:02.280
when the Multiverse
is in danger.

624
00:36:02.313 --> 00:36:04.081
- And now that Barry's
taking Ramsey Rosso

625
00:36:04.114 --> 00:36:05.382
back to A.R.G.U.S.,

626
00:36:05.447 --> 00:36:07.251
it's safe to say
everyone's out of danger.

627
00:36:07.284 --> 00:36:10.086
- So the Multiverse
exists again?

628
00:36:10.121 --> 00:36:11.588
- It's a miracle.

629
00:36:11.621 --> 00:36:13.090
- Uh, isn't it science?

630
00:36:13.123 --> 00:36:15.092
- I think it's a little of both.

631
00:36:15.126 --> 00:36:18.128
- I understand.

632
00:36:18.161 --> 00:36:19.496
It was you.

633
00:36:19.528 --> 00:36:21.164
You're the presence that told me

634
00:36:21.197 --> 00:36:24.402
to go back to S.T.A.R. Labs
so that I could save Diggle.

635
00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:26.403
- Khione, you're connected
to the natural world,

636
00:36:26.436 --> 00:36:28.471
so you were able to use
your powers to expel

637
00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:31.342
the unnatural inside of John.

638
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:33.443
- That's a lot to digest.

639
00:36:33.476 --> 00:36:36.012
I'm going to go meditate.

640
00:36:36.047 --> 00:36:38.349
- Okay.

641
00:36:38.382 --> 00:36:41.117
So now what?

642
00:36:41.152 --> 00:36:42.619
- Um...

643
00:36:42.652 --> 00:36:44.789
wasn't there a party happening?

644
00:36:49.427 --> 00:36:51.061
- Cheers.

645
00:36:55.065 --> 00:36:56.599
<i>- You okay?</i>

646
00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:01.438
- Honestly, I have no idea.

647
00:37:04.942 --> 00:37:07.610
- Barry told me what
Ramsey showed you...

648
00:37:07.643 --> 00:37:09.813
Your room at Mom's house.

649
00:37:09.847 --> 00:37:12.983
I can't imagine how
painful that was.

650
00:37:13.016 --> 00:37:14.952
- Yeah, well...

651
00:37:14.985 --> 00:37:17.619
I know I'm not going to
find an answer to that pain

652
00:37:17.653 --> 00:37:19.990
in the Multiverse.

653
00:37:20.023 --> 00:37:22.126
I have to look within.

654
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:24.128
Sometimes it just...

655
00:37:24.161 --> 00:37:26.463
feels impossible.

656
00:37:26.496 --> 00:37:29.666
- To cease from
evil, to do good,

657
00:37:29.699 --> 00:37:32.036
and to purify the
mind yourself...

658
00:37:32.068 --> 00:37:34.536
That is the teaching
of all Buddhas.

659
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.940
What? I read your long-ass
emails you'd send me.

660
00:37:39.708 --> 00:37:42.679
- Thank you. Thanks
for everything.

661
00:37:42.711 --> 00:37:45.016
You're going to be the best mom.

662
00:37:45.048 --> 00:37:47.583
- And you're gonna
be the best uncle.

663
00:37:47.617 --> 00:37:49.320
Mm, come here.

664
00:37:54.523 --> 00:37:55.523
- Guys...

665
00:37:59.362 --> 00:38:00.764
Mmm!

666
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:05.668
- Lyla wants me back at
A.R.G.U.S. to debrief her

667
00:38:05.702 --> 00:38:08.371
on the festivities.

668
00:38:08.405 --> 00:38:10.875
- Duty calls.
- Hmm.

669
00:38:13.878 --> 00:38:15.644
So...

670
00:38:15.677 --> 00:38:18.048
are you going to get
to see her this time?

671
00:38:18.081 --> 00:38:20.518
- Um...

672
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.353
My...

673
00:38:22.385 --> 00:38:25.688
powers came with rules.

674
00:38:25.722 --> 00:38:28.690
Me and Felicity...

675
00:38:28.724 --> 00:38:30.960
our destiny has been written.

676
00:38:30.994 --> 00:38:34.065
- You sure would be proud of
her, Ollie, the kids, too.

677
00:38:34.097 --> 00:38:36.132
William... he's in college.

678
00:38:36.166 --> 00:38:37.835
Mia...

679
00:38:37.867 --> 00:38:40.771
Mia can climb a salmon ladder,
man, with the best of them.

680
00:38:40.804 --> 00:38:42.873
I know. I know.

681
00:38:42.907 --> 00:38:45.242
I've been keeping
an eye on them...

682
00:38:45.275 --> 00:38:46.543
- Yeah.

683
00:38:46.576 --> 00:38:48.278
- And on you.

684
00:38:52.416 --> 00:38:56.652
John, that cube was
designed to tempt you.

685
00:38:58.255 --> 00:39:01.057
But you did the right thing.

686
00:39:01.092 --> 00:39:05.396
And now all of your brightest
days are ahead of you

687
00:39:05.429 --> 00:39:08.164
because they'll be
spent with your family.

688
00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:11.068
- You're my family, Oliver.

689
00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:14.704
I'm just glad I get to say
goodbye to you this time.

690
00:39:16.106 --> 00:39:17.673
- Me too.

691
00:39:17.706 --> 00:39:19.242
I love you, John.

692
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.114
- Love you, too, brother.

693
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.922
<i>- So you got to tell me
about these other Earths.</i>

694
00:39:31.956 --> 00:39:35.126
I mean, how many other
Flashes are there?

695
00:39:35.159 --> 00:39:38.561
- Uh...

696
00:39:38.596 --> 00:39:41.030
- More than enough, but...

697
00:39:41.065 --> 00:39:45.603
I got to say, nobody is
more impressive than you.

698
00:39:45.635 --> 00:39:49.005
How many times have you
saved your city now... 170?

699
00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:51.442
- 180, actually.

700
00:39:53.244 --> 00:39:54.445
- It's all because of you.

701
00:39:54.478 --> 00:39:56.112
I mean, you started this.
- Well...

702
00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:58.114
- I don't know what my
life would have been like

703
00:39:58.148 --> 00:40:00.784
if I hadn't taken that
train to Star City.

704
00:40:00.818 --> 00:40:03.420
- You still would
have been a hero.

705
00:40:03.454 --> 00:40:05.523
- Maybe.

706
00:40:05.556 --> 00:40:08.690
But you made me a better one.

707
00:40:08.724 --> 00:40:10.994
- You made me a better man.

708
00:40:11.027 --> 00:40:13.197
<i>Prochnost.</i>

709
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.465
<i>- Prochnost.</i>

710
00:40:14.498 --> 00:40:16.900
- Very... very good.
- Okay.

711
00:40:18.469 --> 00:40:21.639
- Okay, Mr. Allen, I think
that I have done enough

712
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.509
to upset the cosmic
order for one night.

713
00:40:25.543 --> 00:40:27.510
Can you get this?

714
00:40:27.545 --> 00:40:30.347
- Are you kidding?
You're a billionaire.

715
00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.916
- Well, you...

716
00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:34.117
you can't take it with you.

717
00:40:35.485 --> 00:40:36.820
Oliver.

718
00:40:36.853 --> 00:40:38.655
Yeah.

719
00:40:38.688 --> 00:40:42.692
I mean, you can see
everything, right?

720
00:40:42.724 --> 00:40:44.661
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:40:44.693 --> 00:40:48.998
- Do you think I'm...
I'm doing enough...

722
00:40:49.032 --> 00:40:53.871
with my powers,
with my time here?

723
00:40:53.903 --> 00:40:56.239
- Well, Barry, you tell me.

724
00:40:59.643 --> 00:41:03.012
Do you give people hope?

725
00:41:03.047 --> 00:41:07.117
Are you moving through
your city like a...

726
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.052
guardian angel?

727
00:41:10.887 --> 00:41:12.489
Do you make a difference?

728
00:41:17.726 --> 00:41:21.898
That bolt of
lightning chose you.

729
00:41:21.931 --> 00:41:25.101
Don't ever forget it.

730
00:41:27.605 --> 00:41:31.708
Oh, and...

731
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.710
happy birthday.

732
00:41:48.592 --> 00:41:50.094
- Thanks.
