1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,032
- This whole thing is going to
be awesome, awesome, awesome.

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:06,134
I'm telling you,

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,035
Operation: Thirty,
Flirty, and Thriving

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,938
is going to be one memorable
shindig... I can feel it.

5
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:12,248
- Yeah, and from
what you told me,

6
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:13,673
it sounds like it's going to be

7
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:15,152
way better than the first
time Barry turned 30.

8
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:17,078
- Oh, yeah, that time Team Flash

9
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:18,521
spent the whole night
fighting Cicada.

10
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,181
- Well, thanks to
Dr. Orloff's gamma ray,

11
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:21,748
Barry's got a
second crack at it,

12
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:24,618
'cause on a cellular
level, he's still just 29.

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,587
Hey, what happened?

14
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:29,157
My readings are
saying that you're...

15
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,590
- Better than ever.

16
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:32,592
- Okay, so as far as
everything else goes,

17
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:34,361
I mean, I think we're good.

18
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:36,039
Chester, you are still in
charge of entertainment.

19
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:38,142
Allegra, you and I have already
done all the decorating.

20
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,400
Khione is picking
up the cake, so...

21
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,669
- Do you guys think he's
going to be surprised?

22
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:44,437
- He better be.

23
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:50,077
- Okay, I just need
to grab my laptop.

24
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,612
Surprise!

25
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:58,418
- Wally, Dig...

26
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,854
You guys got me.

27
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,289
- Come here, man.

28
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,456
Happy birthday.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

29
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,458
- May your current
rotation around the sun

30
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:08,395
be your best yet.
- Okay.

31
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:10,798
Thank you. Guys!

32
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:36,224
- Yo, party people,
let's get wild!

33
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:39,927
- It's got dried
sendru and honey.

34
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:42,063
It'll be good for your
morning sickness, I hope,

35
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,663
and it tastes delicious.

36
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:45,565
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers.

37
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,001
- Mmm.
- Oh, yeah?

38
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:48,578
- Barry, you have to try this.
- Oh, yeah?

39
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:50,670
- Excuse us. Barry,
happy birthday.

40
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:52,206
Can you settle something for us?

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,640
- Sure.

42
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:55,709
- See, I think I was
a better CCPD captain

43
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,979
because I'm not a meta-human.
- Oh.

44
00:01:58,012 --> 00:01:59,379
- It keeps me objective.

45
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,082
- Chief, having
meta-abilities gives me

46
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:03,260
a better understanding of
what meta-criminals go through

47
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:04,584
and how they're thinking.

48
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:06,320
- Being human
implies I'm treating

49
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:08,222
meta-criminals and
non-meta-criminals equally.

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,457
- Actually, it implies
you're more biased

51
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,294
because non-metas set up the
system in the first place.

52
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:15,062
What do you think?

53
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:17,697
- Um, that...

54
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:21,869
Central City is lucky
to have you both.

55
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:24,537
- Okay, okay, do you guys
mind if I borrow the man

56
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,672
of the hour for a moment?

57
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,474
I have a special gift for him.

58
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,911
How does it feel being

59
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,444
- Unreal, I guess.

60
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:33,223
- Because it's special,
Barry, which means it

61
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,383
requires a special gift.

62
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,085
- Dig, I...
- No, no, please, open it.

63
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,360
- We thought we lost it
when Earth-38 was destroyed.

64
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,296
But A.R.G.U.S. Found
it in National City.

65
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:56,503
It's hard to believe it's
been three years, right?

66
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:58,505
Sometimes I'll be at
the grocery store, man,

67
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:01,342
or with my kids, and, uh...

68
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,178
grief will hit me
all over again.

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,416
- Yeah.

70
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:09,984
It's hard.

71
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:13,287
We don't get the chance
to say goodbye to someone.

72
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,389
- I'm sorry to
hear about Caitlin,

73
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:17,524
losing her so soon after Frost.

74
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,794
- Eh, having Khione's helped.

75
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:23,965
But something about it all
still just doesn't feel right.

76
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:27,701
That's why I-I
can't accept this.

77
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:30,004
- Barry, Oliver would have
wanted you to have this.

78
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,471
- I'm sorry, Dig.

79
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:35,675
Maybe we should just
display it in the hall.

80
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,148
- Does Khione need
help with the cake?

81
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:42,960
- Oh, she said there's a
huge line at the bakery.

82
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:45,585
So I figured, while
we're waiting,

83
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:48,823
I might as well give you this.

84
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:51,125
- You know it's not
my birthday, right?

85
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,394
- It's just a little
something that I made you

86
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:57,131
for our one-month anniversary.

87
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:59,133
- It's beautiful.

88
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,768
- And it's not just for show.

89
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,004
I know you've been worried
about the "light meta" buzz,

90
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:05,806
so I designed this to
conceal your identity.

91
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,575
It's got a facial
transmogrifier inside it.

92
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:10,677
This way, you can
concentrate on using

93
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,980
all your powers to kick ass

94
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:15,950
and not on trying
to hide your face.

95
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:19,453
- Thanks. That'll
come in handy.

96
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:21,654
- Plus, now got a
little piece of me

97
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:24,392
keeping you safe out there.

98
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:25,993
I love it.

99
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:27,762
And I love you, too.

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,576
- ♪ Yo, I'll tell
you what I want ♪

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,436
♪ What I really, really want ♪

102
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,481
- ♪ Yo, tell me what you want,
what you really, really want ♪

103
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:39,548
- ♪ I'll tell you what I want,
what I really, really want ♪

104
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,209
- ♪ Yo, tell me what you want,
what you really, really want ♪

105
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,643
- That's a hit.

106
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,479
♪ I wanna, I wanna, I wanna ♪

107
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:47,747
- ♪ I wanna really, really,
really wanna zigazag, ah ♪

108
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:50,518
- You know there's a whole party

109
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,454
going on in there, right?

110
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,456
I just needed some air.
- Hmm.

111
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,525
- Hey, thanks for coming
all the way for this.

112
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:58,859
How are the Himalayas?

113
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:01,028
- Well, Bakinimal has
been helping me a lot

114
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:03,663
with my journey to
enlightenment, which is good.

115
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:06,200
Um, but when Iris told
me about the Red Death,

116
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,600
it kind of gave me an idea.

117
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:09,636
You know how I can
project my consciousness

118
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,172
into the Speed Force?

119
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:14,442
Well, I've been doing it to
find alternate timelines.

120
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,708
- What for?

121
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:17,020
- Since there are
other timelines,

122
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:18,578
there's probably
another me out there

123
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,713
who has already
achieved enlightenment

124
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,749
and could help me find it, too.
- Wow.

125
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:26,253
I mean, you already seem
so in touch with yourself.

126
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:30,324
Can't you do it on your own?
- I wish it was that simple.

127
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:33,894
Um, true awakening requires a
deep examination of the self.

128
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:36,497
And when you have baggage
like I do, it's just...

129
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,665
It can hold you back.

130
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,801
- What baggage?

131
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,636
I just... I thought the whole
point of you going to Tibet

132
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,474
was to deal with
things from your past.

133
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:54,915
- Just forget it.

134
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,119
Happy birthday.

135
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:04,425
- Sparkling cider

136
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,926
for the hostess.
- Mm.

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,660
- Champagne for
the birthday boy.

138
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,396
- Thank you.

139
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,575
- Okay, everybody, ting, ting,
ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.

140
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,767
Please, raise a glass
for the birthday boy.

141
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,603
- Oh.
- Happy birthday.

142
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:17,404
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday.

143
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:18,806
- Happy birthday, Barry.
- Speech.

144
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,208
- Speech.
- Speech, speech, speech.

145
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:23,477
- I mean, what can I
say, except, um, I feel

146
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,779
really lucky to have
the best friends

147
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,680
and family in the world.

148
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:29,383
So here's to you guys.

149
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,717
I love you all.

150
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,987
Cheers.
- Cheers.

151
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,054
- Cheers.

152
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,060
- Chester, this cider
tastes a little expired.

153
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:43,497
- It's not just the cider.
- I don't feel so good.

154
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:44,531
- Yeah, me neither.

155
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:50,703
- Everybody stop drinking now.

156
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,739
Iris, hey.

157
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:01,215
- Barry, what is happening?

158
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,750
- Quite the
festivities, Mr. Allen.

159
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:07,121
My invitation must have
been lost in the mail.

160
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:20,501
I hope you don't mind
me crashing your party.

161
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,476
- Why all the sour faces?

162
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,812
Don't tell me I've
missed the cake.

163
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:35,883
- What did you do to them?

164
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,018
- Is this how you
greet an old friend,

165
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:40,421
especially one that's
just escaped A.R.G.U.S.?

166
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:42,523
You know, I came right back here

167
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:44,291
so we could pick up
where we left off.

168
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,961
And now I find out you're
having a party without me.

169
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:48,862
- Look, I don't know you,

170
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:51,532
but I know that we can
solve this without violence.

171
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,801
- Mr. West...

172
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,169
I don't want violence.

173
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:56,937
I simply wish to save the world.

174
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,639
- You don't want to save anyone.

175
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:00,874
You're a monster who
wants to absorb us all

176
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:02,509
into your sick mind.

177
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:05,246
- Is that such an unfair
price to pay for immortality?

178
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,215
- You hurt Iris, I will wipe
every last one of your cells

179
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:09,316
off this planet.

180
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,750
- Fear not.

181
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:12,553
Your wife is perfectly
safe and healthy,

182
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,388
and she'll stay
that way forever,

183
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:17,258
which means your daughter will
never know an orphan's grief.

184
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,627
On the contrary,
little Nora West-Allen

185
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,897
would be the first blood baby
born into a whole new world.

186
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:29,136
Your anger means nothing, Barry.

187
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,572
Now, last time, I made you
into a blood brother first,

188
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:34,441
only for your meddlesome
team to rise up against me.

189
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:37,144
But this time, they
won't have that chance.

190
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:40,581
And soon, your meager healing
factors will run out, too.

191
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,383
- I don't know
what you're up to,

192
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,686
but you're not going to
get into my head again.

193
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:48,188
- But, Barry...

194
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:52,760
I already am.

195
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:13,013
Time to begin the good work.

196
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:16,984
Someone didn't drink
their champagne.

197
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:21,689
- Uh, bro, I'm not
really much of a drinker.

198
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,157
- That's no fun.

199
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,592
Now I'm going to have to
bring the party to you.

200
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,803
- Sweet Duane Jones.

201
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:40,874
Oh, no, frak this.

202
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,181
- How fascinating.

203
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:51,151
You're sharing your oxygen
with the embryo inside you.

204
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:54,455
And she's sharing her
healing factors with you.

205
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:57,191
- We're going to stop you.
- No, you won't.

206
00:09:57,224 --> 00:10:00,829
I've been playing the
long game, and you...

207
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,863
have already lost.

208
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:08,102
- Ramsey!

209
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:11,939
I know you can hear me!

210
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:14,141
You can't fool me again.

211
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:16,009
Those visions you
showed me last time,

212
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:18,612
they were lies,
made to tempt me!

213
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:21,850
- I never lied to you, Barry.

214
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:24,585
I just showed you
a future where you

215
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:27,020
had the power to end death.

216
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:29,791
But you rejected my offer.

217
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:34,027
And now your friends
are dropping like flies.

218
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:38,098
Nash, Caitlin, Frost...
It's quite the list.

219
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:41,468
- You can't break me again.
- I don't need to, Barry.

220
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:45,038
This time I have a more
interesting target in mind,

221
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:49,878
just as fleet-footed,
too, only more perceptive.

222
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,780
- Wally.

223
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,186
- Wally.

224
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,454
Son.

225
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,723
Wally?

226
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:06,427
Mama needs her medicine.

227
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,632
Wally!

228
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:15,002
Mama needs her
medicine. Wally...

229
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:17,070
- I'm sorry, Mr. West.

230
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:19,440
I thought seeing your childhood
home would be comforting,

231
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:23,243
but I suppose it
is rather spartan,

232
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:26,580
especially compared to Barry's.

233
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,315
- Why'd you bring me here?

234
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:30,417
- Because you need
a friend, Wallace,

235
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,419
and because we can
help each other.

236
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:33,788
- I'd never help you.

237
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:35,656
- But you already have.

238
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:38,225
You see, the last time I
encountered Team Flash,

239
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:40,260
when I possessed Barry's mind,

240
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:42,931
I learned what was coming...

241
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:47,802
A crisis to end the Multiverse.

242
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:49,938
But I guess it didn't take.

243
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,246
- No, you're wrong.

244
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,982
The Multiverse is dead.

245
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,585
I know because I lost Jesse.

246
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:08,857
She's never coming back.

247
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,324
- Tell me something, Wallace.

248
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,326
What did you see
out there when you

249
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,161
projected your consciousness...

250
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,965
Alternate timelines...

251
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,433
or other Earths?

252
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:21,735
Yes, Wallace, you
can sense them.

253
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:24,438
So isn't it possible that
there's another Jesse Quick

254
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:26,607
out there somewhere just waiting

255
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,209
for her Prince Charming
to come and find her?

256
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,513
- You're trying to trick me,

257
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:35,449
but you can't tempt me
with simple desires.

258
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:37,184
I know my truth.

259
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:40,387
- And why have you failed in
your quest for enlightenment?

260
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,992
I know you've been wrestling
with the darkness inside you

261
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:47,060
and how desperate you are
to rid yourself of it.

262
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:50,697
But you can't, not on your own.

263
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,065
Let me help you.

264
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,535
- How, by turning
me into a zombie?

265
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:59,007
- No, by unlocking
your true potential.

266
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:03,210
This is your future,
Wally West.

267
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:05,612
You will enlighten
the entire world

268
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:08,749
and all the other worlds
yet to be discovered.

269
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:17,257
All you have to
do is choose life.

270
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,862
- No, y-you turned everybody
I loved into your slave.

271
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,362
That's not choice.

272
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,531
- I understand your hesitation.

273
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,634
No one has ever really
believed in you, have they?

274
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:30,304
You have been cut
down your entire life,

275
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:34,074
forced to watch
your mother suffer.

276
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:37,744
It is a pain that I
know all too well.

277
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:42,917
My mother was
diagnosed with HLH,

278
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:45,954
and I couldn't save
her either, Wally.

279
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:48,890
I had to watch her die.

280
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:50,724
- And we have that in common.

281
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:54,461
- Then you understand what it
is that I'm trying to do...

282
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,296
That it's about more
than just stopping death.

283
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,966
It is about ending the suffering

284
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,003
that we have both endured,
that, together, we can create

285
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:04,772
a Multiverse where
no one has to watch

286
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:07,608
their loved ones die...

287
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,176
ever again.

288
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:18,552
- Okay, okay, just me.

289
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:21,022
Okay, all your
friends are zombies.

290
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,390
But it's, uh... it's
okay. It's okay.

291
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:26,326
You just got to call for help.

292
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,595
- Hello? Is anyone there?

293
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:29,897
- Iris?

294
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:31,465
Oh, I thought you were a zombie.

295
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:33,600
- Little Nora's
healing factor...

296
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:36,603
I-it's holding off
the infection for now.

297
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:38,605
Look, I locked myself
in a time vault,

298
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,844
but someone cut the power
to the outside comms.

299
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,144
- Iris?

300
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,179
Iris, can you hear me?

301
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,415
- I've been waiting
for you, Chuck.

302
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:52,486
What, don't you want to
give your lover a kiss?

303
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,355
- No, no, no, no.
You're not Allegra.

304
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:58,191
You're Ramsey
controlling her body.

305
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:01,029
- And what a
powerful body it is.

306
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,663
- Doing this to
people ain't a gift.

307
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:05,499
- What else would you
call eternal life?

308
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:07,167
- I'd call it hell on Earth.

309
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,971
- You know what?
I'll leave you alone.

310
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,780
Unfortunately, the rest
of my brothers and sisters

311
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:20,447
have different plans.

312
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:25,686
- Leave Wally alone.

313
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,220
- Don't worry.

314
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,189
I have no intention
of harming him.

315
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:32,093
But if I did, it
would be just one more

316
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:34,194
sacrifice in your name, right?

317
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:36,663
Sorry.

318
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:41,268
Is it me, or is the lighting
in here a tad too melodramatic?

319
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,705
Can I get a grip or an
electrician over here?

320
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,177
- What the hell? Where are we?

321
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,545
- Language, Barry,
it's a family show.

322
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,723
Now you'll have to keep up if
we're going to make our day.

323
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:56,150
After all, you're
the star of the show.

324
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,425
- Wait, what's...
What's happening?

325
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,762
- Okay, ready to try one?
- What is this?

326
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:08,896
What are you doing?

327
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,430
- Making you look good, champ.

328
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:13,134
All right, lock it up.

329
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,108
- Hey, man, love your work.

330
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,910
Roll sound.

331
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:27,048
- Mark.

332
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,817
- Ready, and action.

333
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,057
- Um...

334
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,192
Hi, kids.

335
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:41,062
I'm the Flash.

336
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,030
Did you know that
when a person survives

337
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:46,067
an event that others didn't,

338
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,236
it can lead to...

339
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:49,837
feelings of guilt?

340
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:54,307
That's a Flash fact.

341
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,578
No, I'm not... I'm
not doing this.

342
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,249
- Cut. That's a cut, everyone.

343
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,186
- Frost.

344
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,024
- It's okay that
she's dead, Barry.

345
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:14,461
It's more important
that you live.

346
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:16,030
You're the star, right?

347
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:18,365
- No. No, that's not true.

348
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,433
- You matter more
than the rest of us.

349
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,903
That's why it's okay

350
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:23,905
that you got those extra
years and we didn't.

351
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:26,808
- I didn't want extra time,
not without all of you.

352
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,910
- Oh, that's lunch.

353
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:40,988
- Wally...

354
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,191
are you okay?

355
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,659
- Young Wallace is
better than ever.

356
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:50,298
He and I had a very
enlightening conversation.

357
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,867
- Listen to me, Wally.

358
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,038
Whatever Ramsey showed
you, it's not real.

359
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,840
- Shut up, Barry.

360
00:17:58,873 --> 00:17:59,941
Just shut up.

361
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:02,542
- This anger isn't you.

362
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:06,314
Ramsey's manipulating you, so
you'll choose to follow him.

363
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,916
It's the only way he can
beat our speed healing

364
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,318
and take over our minds.

365
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,019
- He doesn't care
about you, Wallace.

366
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:15,589
He's been living with your
father, pawing at your sister,

367
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:18,025
while you were trapped
in that hellhole.

368
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,794
- You were living my life.

369
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:23,430
- Wally, I know how hard
it was for you growing up.

370
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:26,100
- No, you don't! You
don't know anything!

371
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:27,945
- But Joe and Iris didn't
even know that you existed.

372
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:31,504
- Keep his name out your mouth.
Joe West is my dad, mine.

373
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:32,807
He's not yours.

374
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,942
But you stole him
anyway from me.

375
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,444
You got to have two
dads who loved you.

376
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:39,113
I had nobody, Barry.

377
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:42,116
You're so selfish.

378
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,285
And you know why?

379
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:48,388
Because you think that you're
the only person that matters.

380
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,724
- Wally...

381
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:52,960
Joe loves you.

382
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,062
And I love you.

383
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,204
- Well, I hate you.

384
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,441
- Yes!

385
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:39,572
- Oh, Barry, Barry, Barry...

386
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:41,809
what have you done this time?

387
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:53,120
- No.

388
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,358
No, Ramsey's still
messing with my head.

389
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:59,626
- Barry, you need to calm down.

390
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:01,896
- You're not real.

391
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,431
How did I get here?

392
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:06,133
Wally, he was a blood
brother. He attacked me.

393
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:12,239
He killed me.

394
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:15,042
- Dying is the easy part.

395
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,509
Remember?

396
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,948
- It's really you.
- Yeah.

397
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:25,752
Okay. Okay.

398
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:27,021
Okay.

399
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:28,889
Okay, let go.

400
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,224
Barry, let go.

401
00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:33,327
- Wait. If you're here,
that means I'm really...

402
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:34,895
- You're dead.

403
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,465
Otherwise, why would I
let you hug me that long?

404
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,771
- But if I'm dead, no
one's there to stop them.

405
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:47,308
Iris, the baby, the... The
whole world is in danger.

406
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:48,809
- I know.

407
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:51,946
But it's not just your
world that's in danger.

408
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:55,082
When I took on the
power of the Spectre,

409
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:58,452
I thought that I was simply
creating Earth-Prime.

410
00:20:58,486 --> 00:21:01,789
But I was also making
something else...

411
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:04,591
A new Multiverse to replace
the one that had fallen.

412
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,496
- But when we fought
the Red Death,

413
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,007
she thought she escaped
from her timeline

414
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,767
into an alternate one.
- She is from Earth-4125.

415
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,335
- You're numbering them?

416
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:16,837
- I've had a bit of
time on my hands...

417
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,874
Keeping an eye on threats
to these new worlds,

418
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:22,943
like your friend Ramsey Rosso.

419
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,812
He wants to spread
his infectious cells

420
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,814
to every world out there.

421
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,783
- No, I mean, Ramsey's powerful,

422
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:30,851
but he's not capable
of something like that.

423
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:34,021
- Right, but with
Wally by his side...

424
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:37,291
Wally thought that he was
projecting his consciousness

425
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:40,528
into the Speed Force to
reach alternate timelines,

426
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,465
when, in fact, he was
reaching other Earths.

427
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:47,535
So, if Ramsey's control

428
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,471
over Wally becomes permanent...

429
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:53,074
- He'll gain control
over the Multiverse, too.

430
00:21:58,846 --> 00:22:01,849
Now, what have we here?

431
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:05,986
Ah, a gift from the boy genius.

432
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,189
You were so worried about
Allegra's protection,

433
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:10,391
you didn't stop and
think about your own.

434
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:13,894
Don't worry.

435
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:15,628
In a few moments,
you won't care.

436
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:26,874
- Sounds like trouble.

437
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:29,376
- No.

438
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,511
- Khione?

439
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,186
Whoa.

440
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,823
What'd you, uh...
what'd you do to her?

441
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:44,859
- Same thing I did to
everyone else out there.

442
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:46,927
I froze all the
water in her body.

443
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:49,696
Oh, don't worry. She's safe.

444
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:51,698
- Wait. How did you
know to find me here?

445
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:53,700
- I was in line
waiting for the cake

446
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:56,904
when I felt a
presence calling me,

447
00:22:56,937 --> 00:22:59,940
telling me that I
was needed here.

448
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:02,709
Only, now I get the
feeling the job isn't done.

449
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,687
- This world will be cured soon.

450
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:18,592
But there are so many
other worlds out there.

451
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,561
I think it's time we started.

452
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:40,648
- Feel them...

453
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:45,319
millions of worlds waiting
for your life blood.

454
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:48,222
- A gateway to the Multiverse.

455
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,990
Thank you, brother.

456
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:55,095
Now infinite souls will
know my gift and rejoice.

457
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:16,584
- The attack's starting.

458
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:18,552
Ramsey's fed his
cells into the breach.

459
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,654
Soon, they are going
to infect your world

460
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:22,423
and all of the worlds
yet to be born.

461
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:25,793
- I have to stop him. You
have to get me out of here.

462
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:28,862
- It's not that simple.
- You have the power of a god.

463
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,598
You can bring me
back from the dead.

464
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:32,533
- No, I can't...

465
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:36,036
not while there is a part of you

466
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,406
that doesn't want to go back.

467
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,709
- That's not true.

468
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,743
- You've always been
a terrible liar.

469
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,919
It's...

470
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:55,723
it's my birthday today.

471
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:56,924
I didn't want to do anything,

472
00:24:56,957 --> 00:24:59,226
but Iris threw
this party, and...

473
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,697
I-I should have been
grateful, happy.

474
00:25:03,731 --> 00:25:06,100
But all I could
think about was...

475
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,837
Everyone who couldn't be there.

476
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,905
- You've lost a lot
of people this year.

477
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:14,642
- Yeah, Frost died
fighting Deathstorm.

478
00:25:14,675 --> 00:25:16,844
Caitlin died trying to save her.

479
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:19,046
I fight some random
mad scientist.

480
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:21,749
I get three extra years to live.

481
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:24,251
You know everything
now, right, Oliver?

482
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:29,456
Tell me, how is it right
I'm alive and they're dead?

483
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,691
How's that fair?

484
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:33,460
- Life is a lot
of things, Barry.

485
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:34,928
Fair isn't on the list.

486
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:37,364
- You don't really believe that.

487
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:40,334
And if you did, your mom
wouldn't be alive again...

488
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:41,935
or Tommy or Lance.

489
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:46,273
You used your powers to bring
back everyone you loved.

490
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:48,609
- Not everyone.

491
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:50,110
- Your dad.

492
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:51,712
- Survive.

493
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:54,415
- No!

494
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:58,619
- Ollie, I'm sorry.
- It's... it's okay.

495
00:25:58,652 --> 00:26:00,120
Bringing him back
would have done

496
00:26:00,154 --> 00:26:03,490
too much to alter reality.

497
00:26:03,524 --> 00:26:06,927
And I'd already done enough
to dishonor his sacrifice.

498
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,196
When my father
sacrificed himself,

499
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:12,499
when he gave me my extra years,

500
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:15,736
what was I doing with them?

501
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,338
I was wasting them.

502
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:20,641
I was drowning
myself in this sea

503
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:23,812
of... of pain and darkness

504
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:25,814
and saying, Ollie,
if you just...

505
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:29,784
If you cross one more
name off the list,

506
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:34,021
if you save your
city one more time,

507
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:36,924
then you'll absolve yourself
of all of this guilt.

508
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:38,659
And I was wrong.

509
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:43,330
This guilt is never
going to go away.

510
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:46,467
It is something that you
have to learn to live with.

511
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,370
That is why people
sacrificed themselves.

512
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:52,740
That is why I sacrificed
myself for you,

513
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:56,677
so that in all of
this darkness...

514
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,379
you...

515
00:27:00,214 --> 00:27:02,549
Could be a guiding light...

516
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:08,021
A hero.

517
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:09,791
- Because heroes
don't stop running.

518
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:11,392
- You're damn right.

519
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:14,194
So...

520
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:16,630
are you ready to keep running?

521
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,269
Good.

522
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:24,571
- Wait, hang on.
You're not going to...

523
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:25,973
boop me again, are you?

524
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:28,208
It kind of killed the
Speed Force last time.

525
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:31,645
- No, no, I'm not gonna...
Not gonna boop you.

526
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:35,082
- Ow!

527
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:37,918
That hurts.
- Living hurts.

528
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:42,689
Add it to the list.

529
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:44,758
- Wait. You came back, too.

530
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,326
- It's just temporary.

531
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,962
I can only intervene when
the Multiverse is in danger.

532
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:50,799
- I think you missed me.

533
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:59,841
- Not as much as I missed this.

534
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,912
Let's go kick some ass.

535
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:16,825
- Ramsey's cells
are metastasizing

536
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:18,125
inside that breach.

537
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:19,693
If we're going to wipe them out,

538
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,628
we need a massive
ultraviolet pulse.

539
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:31,538
How'd he do that? I thought
you were the Spectre.

540
00:28:31,572 --> 00:28:34,975
- The attack on the Multiverse
is weakening my powers.

541
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,912
I need a clear
shot at the breach.

542
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:41,181
- The Flash and Green
Arrow together again?

543
00:28:41,215 --> 00:28:43,785
I am honored.
- Don't be.

544
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:46,353
- Wally, you don't
have to do this.

545
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:48,021
Too late, Flash.

546
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:50,792
Wallace worships
a new faith now.

547
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:54,361
He worships at the
altar of Bloodwork.

548
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:02,669
- You are starting
to piss me off.

549
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:04,404
- Why?

550
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:07,040
I'm only trying to improve your
Multiverse by ending death.

551
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,543
Then I can bring
every world together

552
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:11,813
under one mind for
singular purpose...

553
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:13,514
Immortality.

554
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:16,985
- Those worlds
don't belong to you.

555
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:18,820
- You're right.

556
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:20,955
They belong to them.

557
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:25,719
- Are you, uh... are you
sure this is going to work?

558
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:27,055
- Trust me.

559
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,532
- That's all I can manage.

560
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:41,035
- Oh! Aah!

561
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,708
Mm.

562
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:52,679
What the hell?

563
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:55,215
Did that come out of me?

564
00:30:55,248 --> 00:30:58,151
Where's Barry?
- He needs your help.

565
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:32,987
- I'm not going to
fight you, Wally.

566
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,288
Wallace is gone.

567
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:37,792
- I know you can hear me.

568
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:41,129
I need you to know I'm sorry,

569
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,864
not just for today,

570
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:45,833
for all the times I've made you
feel like you didn't matter.

571
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:51,238
- Everyone has
darkness inside them.

572
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:54,574
There is no cure for that
pain. We can only accept it.

573
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:56,710
That's the only
way we can beat it.

574
00:31:56,743 --> 00:32:00,081
You can do this, Wally.
You can beat him.

575
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:02,984
I know you can!
- No!

576
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,588
- Brother/sister
crime-fighting unit.

577
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,792
No.

578
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,061
No!

579
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:24,738
- I killed you. I'm sorry.

580
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:26,174
- I came back.

581
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:31,712
Now let's go save
the Multiverse.

582
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:44,658
- Impressive...

583
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,594
but let's see how
you fare against me.

584
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,208
- Oliver.

585
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,044
- I can explain.

586
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:05,079
- It doesn't matter, man.

587
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,385
- How touching.

588
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,622
Unfortunately, this reunion
will be short-lived.

589
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,560
- That's one ugly
son of a bitch.

590
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:48,321
- Oliver, we got
you a clear shot.

591
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:54,262
- Ramsey Rosso!

592
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:57,265
You have failed this city!

593
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:26,127
+
- I feel like I just recovered

594
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,830
from the world's worst hangover.

595
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:30,430
- I think we all did.

596
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:32,699
- The last thing I remember
is drinking champagne.

597
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:33,768
What happened?

598
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:36,103
- Ramsey's having
a very bad day.

599
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:39,140
- Hey, what about Allegra?

600
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:41,075
- Chuck.

601
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:58,159
- What have you done to me?

602
00:34:58,192 --> 00:34:59,693
I'm human again.

603
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:01,896
- I've cleansed the
entire Multiverse

604
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:03,164
of your infectious cells.

605
00:35:03,197 --> 00:35:04,966
- including the ones inside you.

606
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,566
- And you killed me.

607
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,535
Now my HLH will return.

608
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:11,839
- I took care of that, too...
Perks of being the Spectre.

609
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:13,640
- So it looks like
you'll be spending

610
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:16,010
the rest of your human
days as a regular criminal.

611
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:18,445
- Where you're going
to rot until old age,

612
00:35:18,478 --> 00:35:20,647
just like everyone else.

613
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,482
- No.

614
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:25,685
I was going to cure death.

615
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,055
I was supposed to
save the world.

616
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:31,259
- Don't worry.
That's our job.

617
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:40,210
- Thank you so much for
protecting my family.

618
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,534
I don't know how much longer

619
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:44,105
little Nora and I
could have held out.

620
00:35:44,138 --> 00:35:45,505
- Well, you're welcome.

621
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:48,642
- I still can't believe
that you're here.

622
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:50,144
- I'm only allowed to intervene

623
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:52,280
when the Multiverse
is in danger.

624
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:54,081
- And now that Barry's
taking Ramsey Rosso

625
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:55,383
back to A.R.G.U.S.,

626
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:57,251
it's safe to say
everyone's out of danger.

627
00:35:57,285 --> 00:36:00,087
- So the Multiverse
exists again?

628
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,588
- It's a miracle.

629
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:03,090
- Uh, isn't it science?

630
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:05,092
- I think it's a little of both.

631
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:08,129
- I understand.

632
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:09,496
It was you.

633
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:11,165
You're the presence that told me

634
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:14,402
to go back to S.T.A.R. Labs
so that I could save Diggle.

635
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:16,404
- Khione, you're connected
to the natural world,

636
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:18,471
so you were able to use
your powers to expel

637
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:21,342
the unnatural inside of John.

638
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,443
- That's a lot to digest.

639
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:26,013
I'm going to go meditate.

640
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,349
- Okay.

641
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:31,118
So now what?

642
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:32,619
- Um...

643
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:34,789
wasn't there a party happening?

644
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:41,062
- Cheers.

645
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:46,599
- You okay?

646
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:51,439
- Honestly, I have no idea.

647
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:57,610
- Barry told me what
Ramsey showed you...

648
00:36:57,644 --> 00:36:59,814
Your room at Mom's house.

649
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,984
I can't imagine how
painful that was.

650
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:04,952
- Yeah, well...

651
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:07,620
I know I'm not going to
find an answer to that pain

652
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:09,991
in the Multiverse.

653
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:12,126
I have to look within.

654
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,128
Sometimes it just...

655
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:16,464
feels impossible.

656
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:19,666
- To cease from
evil, to do good,

657
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:22,036
and to purify the
mind yourself...

658
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:24,537
That is the teaching
of all Buddhas.

659
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,941
What? I read your long-ass
emails you'd send me.

660
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:32,679
- Thank you. Thanks
for everything.

661
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:35,016
You're going to be the best mom.

662
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:37,584
- And you're gonna
be the best uncle.

663
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:39,320
Mm, come here.

664
00:37:44,524 --> 00:37:45,524
- Guys...

665
00:37:49,363 --> 00:37:50,765
Mmm!

666
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,668
- Lyla wants me back at
A.R.G.U.S. to debrief her

667
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:58,372
on the festivities.

668
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:00,875
- Duty calls.
- Hmm.

669
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:05,645
So...

670
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:08,049
are you going to get
to see her this time?

671
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:10,518
- Um...

672
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,353
My...

673
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:15,688
powers came with rules.

674
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:18,691
Me and Felicity...

675
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:20,961
our destiny has been written.

676
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:24,065
- You sure would be proud of
her, Ollie, the kids, too.

677
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:26,133
William... he's in college.

678
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,835
Mia...

679
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:30,771
Mia can climb a salmon ladder,
man, with the best of them.

680
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:32,873
I know. I know.

681
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:35,242
I've been keeping
an eye on them...

682
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:36,544
- Yeah.

683
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:38,279
- And on you.

684
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:46,653
John, that cube was
designed to tempt you.

685
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:51,058
But you did the right thing.

686
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:55,396
And now all of your brightest
days are ahead of you

687
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:58,165
because they'll be
spent with your family.

688
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,068
- You're my family, Oliver.

689
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:04,704
I'm just glad I get to say
goodbye to you this time.

690
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:07,674
- Me too.

691
00:39:07,707 --> 00:39:09,243
I love you, John.

692
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:13,114
- Love you, too, brother.

693
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,922
- So you got to tell me
about these other Earths.

694
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:25,126
I mean, how many other
Flashes are there?

695
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,562
- Uh...

696
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:31,031
- More than enough, but...

697
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:35,603
I got to say, nobody is
more impressive than you.

698
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:39,006
How many times have you
saved your city now... 170?

699
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,442
- 180, actually.

700
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:44,445
- It's all because of you.

701
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:46,113
I mean, you started this.
- Well...

702
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:48,115
- I don't know what my
life would have been like

703
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:50,784
if I hadn't taken that
train to Star City.

704
00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:53,420
- You still would
have been a hero.

705
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:55,523
- Maybe.

706
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:58,691
But you made me a better one.

707
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:00,995
- You made me a better man.

708
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:03,197
Prochnost.

709
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,465
- Prochnost.

710
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,901
- Very... very good.
- Okay.

711
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:11,639
- Okay, Mr. Allen, I think
that I have done enough

712
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:15,509
to upset the cosmic
order for one night.

713
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,511
Can you get this?

714
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,347
- Are you kidding?
You're a billionaire.

715
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:21,916
- Well, you...

716
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:24,118
you can't take it with you.

717
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:26,820
Oliver.

718
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:28,656
Yeah.

719
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:32,692
I mean, you can see
everything, right?

720
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:34,662
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:40:34,694 --> 00:40:38,999
- Do you think I'm...
I'm doing enough...

722
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:43,871
with my powers,
with my time here?

723
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,240
- Well, Barry, you tell me.

724
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:53,013
Do you give people hope?

725
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:57,117
Are you moving through
your city like a...

726
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:59,053
guardian angel?

727
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,489
Do you make a difference?

728
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:11,899
That bolt of
lightning chose you.

729
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:15,102
Don't ever forget it.

730
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:21,709
Oh, and...

731
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:23,711
happy birthday.

732
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:40,094
- Thanks.
