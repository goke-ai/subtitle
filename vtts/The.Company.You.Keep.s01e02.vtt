00:00:00.546 --> 00:00:02.335
<i>- Previously on "The
Company You Keep"...</i>


2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.131
- So what do you do?

3
00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:05.365
- I'm a yoga instructor.

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.702
You?
- Oh, me?


5
00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:08.965
Pageant queen turned rocket scientist.
<i>- Mm.</i>


6
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.758
- My son was impressed
with your offer.


7
00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:12.368
- How did you say you and Connor

8
00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:13.319
came to know one another?

9
00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:14.231
- Oh, I didn't.

10
00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:16.121
- I can't believe
we pulled that off.


11
00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:17.539
- Did you get it?
- Of course I got it.


12
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.341
- I'm thinking we keep
these for the honeymoon.


13
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.012
- Can you hand me
the cold wallet?


14
00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:23.335
- She lied to me
about who she was.


15
00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:29.965
<i>Maybe we just stay
here, do this.</i>


16
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.675
<i>- Fantasy is one thing, Charlie.</i>

17
00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:33.051
Reality is another.

18
00:00:33.052 --> 00:00:34.218
- I wanna take you on that date.

19
00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.249
<i>- Daphne Finch.</i>

20
00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:37.150
<i>Maguire brought her in
as a kind of consultant.</i>


21
00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:39.097
- You owe us the 10
million you stole,


22
00:00:39.098 --> 00:00:40.432
plus an additional five.

23
00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:41.850
Let's call it the
cost of getting


24
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:43.350
Mr. Maguire out of prison.

25
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:45.144
Get to stealing, Charlie.

26
00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:50.690
- Let's start the
bidding at $100,000.


27
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:52.983
Do I have $100,000? $100,000.

28
00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:54.234
- Okay, team, this place is

29
00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:56.528
practically swimming with marks.

30
00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:58.779
First one to find one
gets a drink on me.


31
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.990
<i>- We own a bar,
Charlie. Nice try.</i>


32
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.282
- $160,000.

33
00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:03.992
Going once.

34
00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:05.826
- Got your eyes on anyone?

35
00:01:05.827 --> 00:01:07.494
- Bidder next to
me says he works


36
00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:10.122
for the Malaysian
advancement fund.


37
00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:11.372
<i>- That's interesting.</i>

38
00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:13.249
Just talked to the guy's driver.

39
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.125
Says his boss is
flying to the Maldives


40
00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:16.585
later this afternoon.

41
00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:18.211
<i>- I wonder what he likes better,</i>

42
00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:20.171
the beaches or their
non-extradition policy.


43
00:01:20.172 --> 00:01:22.673
- He also hasn't bid
on a single item.


44
00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:25.592
My guess is, he's waiting
for the big showstopper.


45
00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:27.051
- Same goes for the
guy on your left.


46
00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:31.096
- Hey, Bird, what's the
story on paddle 362?


47
00:01:31.097 --> 00:01:34.599
- Well, whoever he is, he
checked in under an alias.


48
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.310
Probably because he works
for the Sinaloa cartel.


49
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:39.144
- We're knocking
off cartels now?


50
00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:41.730
- Well, as long as we're in
the hole for $15 million.


51
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.939
- Hey, guys, stealing
for other people sucks.


52
00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:50.028
<i>- ♪ That's what I want ♪</i>

53
00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:51.820
<i>- Hey, Charlie, what
happened to tapping me</i>


54
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:52.946
<i>into their routing system?</i>

55
00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:54.448
- Yeah, I'm on it.

56
00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:55.857
<i>- ♪ Money ♪
- ♪ That's ♪</i>


57
00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.241
<i>♪ ♪</i>

58
00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.826
- Hey, man, Stephen says
he needs you backstage.


59
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.119
He looks pissed.

60
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.787
- Who's Stephen?

61
00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.789
- You're joking, right?

62
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.295
<i>- ♪ Oh, oh ♪</i>

63
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.488

<i>- ♪ Give me money ♪</i>

69
00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:20.510
- You all right there, pal?

70
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:22.178
- My boss is have me driving
their dog, Duchess, around.


71
00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.720
Didn't want her to get on my ass

72
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:25.514
for being covered in slobber.

73
00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:26.556
- Who's your boss?

74
00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:27.724
- Name's Ellsworth.

75
00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:29.767
A real pair of
peacocks, those two.


76
00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:32.102
- Next up, our final lot:

77
00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:34.562
a black diamond necklace
rumored to have belonged


78
00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:36.064
to the Romanovs.

79
00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:38.273
Our starting bid is $300,000.

80
00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:40.150
Do I have $300,000?

81
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:42.443
$300,000. $300,000.

82
00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:44.278
How about $325,000?

83
00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.446
$325,000.

84
00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:48.323
Can you surprise
me with $350,000?


85
00:02:48.324 --> 00:02:49.908
$350,000.

86
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.617
<i>- I can't stand the suspense.</i>

87
00:02:51.618 --> 00:02:52.701
<i>Which one of these
crooks are we gonna rob?</i>


88
00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:55.245
- We got $375,000.

89
00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:57.247
Can you beat that with $400,000?

90
00:02:57.248 --> 00:02:58.873
$400,000.

91
00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:00.165
Going once.

92
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.291
Going twice.

93
00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:04.294
- $500,000.

94
00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:07.964
- The bid was $425,000.

95
00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:10.840
But for you, it's a bargain.

96
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:12.425
- Sold for half a million even.

97
00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:16.303
<i>- Oh, that's weird.</i>

98
00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:19.138
So the funds are being wired
into a numbered shell corp.


99
00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.765
- Why is that weird?

100
00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:21.766
- Because the name
of the company


101
00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.183
is Duchess Incorporated.

102
00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:25.686
Isn't that the
name of their dog?


103
00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:28.104
So the buyer and the
seller are the same person,


104
00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:31.107
<i>Claude Ellsworth, former
ambassador to Russia.</i>


105
00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:35.277
And before that, he made
a mint in the oil biz.


106
00:03:35.278 --> 00:03:37.236
- There's only one reason
a guy sells himself


107
00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:38.988
a necklace he already owns.

108
00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.281
- To launder it.
- Bingo.


109
00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:43.491
- Well, it's probably a
kickback from the Kremlin.


110
00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:45.617
It says here that
Ellsworth helped lift


111
00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:46.911
Russian energy sanctions.

112
00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.331
- That's our corrupt buyer?
- Oh, come on.


113
00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:57.669
Don't judge a crook
by their cover, Mom.


114
00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:10.721
<i>- They're holding you here
on some old weapons charge</i>


115
00:04:10.722 --> 00:04:11.971
because they know
they can't make


116
00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:14.264
a RICO case stick.

117
00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:15.891
- Care to know what
I ate for breakfast?


118
00:04:15.892 --> 00:04:18.059
- It is only a matter
of time before they...


119
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.187
- Boiled eggs and powdered milk.

120
00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:24.189
But it's not just me that's
lacking in nourishment, is it?


121
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.441
There's the matter of
our revenue stream,


122
00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:28.901
all dried up now that
we're down $10 million,


123
00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.737
with no distribution hub.

124
00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:32.571
- Yes, I am aware. And I...

125
00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.156
- There's also the
matter of our rivals,


126
00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:36.532
who now know we're
on the FBI's radar.


127
00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:37.992
And God knows who else's.

128
00:04:37.993 --> 00:04:40.036
- So we use that
to our advantage.


129
00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:42.746
Lure our enemies out by making
ourselves look vulnerable.


130
00:04:42.747 --> 00:04:45.539
- We are vulnerable.

131
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.082
Maybe I should call in Connor.

132
00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.168
- Maybe you should.

133
00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.209
Need I remind you?

134
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.295
He is the reason you're in here.

135
00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:54.838
Perhaps if your son spent
less time in the gym


136
00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.840
and more time vetting
that warehouse deal...


137
00:04:56.841 --> 00:04:58.507
- It was Connor's deal,

138
00:04:58.508 --> 00:05:00.509
but it was all part
of your grand plan.


139
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.261
- Then let me see it through.

140
00:05:02.262 --> 00:05:04.721
I will figure out a way
to keep the lights on


141
00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:06.515
and platform our expansion.

142
00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:16.855
- Maguire met his lawyer.

143
00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:18.774
So what?

144
00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:20.275
- She's not his lawyer.

145
00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:21.859
This Daphne woman
knows we're watching,


146
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.402
which is why she's
using the veil


147
00:05:23.403 --> 00:05:24.820
of attorney-client privilege

148
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:25.987
to conspire with him.

149
00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:27.989
- Sounds speculative.

150
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.282
- Deductive, actually.

151
00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:30.491
- Well, last I checked,

152
00:05:30.492 --> 00:05:32.242
Connor Maguire is
the heir apparent,


153
00:05:32.243 --> 00:05:33.827
and he's...
- Back in Belfast, I know.


154
00:05:33.828 --> 00:05:35.453
- Which means the Maguires
are no longer pursuing


155
00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:37.121
their East Coast expansion.

156
00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:38.706
- That's what they
want us to think.


157
00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:40.040
The fact that this
Daphne woman's


158
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:42.167
still in town says otherwise.

159
00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.669
Get me coverage on her hotel,

160
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.294
and I'll prove they're
playing possum.


161
00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:48.005
- You wanna plant a
bug on a U. S. citizen


162
00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:51.174
with no record and two
Ivy League degrees?


163
00:05:51.175 --> 00:05:52.926
- A US citizen who's
risen in the ranks


164
00:05:52.927 --> 00:05:54.636
of a transnational
crime syndicate.


165
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.306
Is that a yes?

166
00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:02.266
- What, like you were gonna
take no for an answer?


167
00:06:06.354 --> 00:06:09.939
- The woman doesn't take
a bad photo, does she?


168
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.690
So we working late
tonight or what?


169
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:13.650
- Why? You got
another hot date?


170
00:06:13.651 --> 00:06:15.319
- No. But apparently you do.

171
00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:18.654
Auto reminder popped
up on your screen:


172
00:06:18.655 --> 00:06:20.240
reservation at Chez Marcel.

173
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.367
Oh, okay.

174
00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:25.575
Do tell.

175
00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:27.661
First date?

176
00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:29.578
- Technically, yes.

177
00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:30.871
But also no.

178
00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:32.331
It's complicated.

179
00:06:32.332 --> 00:06:33.701
- Wait, is this the
guy you hooked up with


180
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:35.250
after Kevin?

181
00:06:35.251 --> 00:06:36.501
Wow.

182
00:06:36.502 --> 00:06:38.961
Good for you.

183
00:06:38.962 --> 00:06:40.713
- What do you mean, good for me?

184
00:06:40.714 --> 00:06:42.631
- For dating your rebound.

185
00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:45.717
I think it's really brave, girl.

186
00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:58.351
- Sure you don't
want that drink?


187
00:06:58.352 --> 00:07:00.854
- Still fine, thanks.

188
00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:02.354
But, uh, you might
wanna get that guy


189
00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.275
another gin and tonic,

190
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.440
because she's about to dump him.

191
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:05.816
Thanks.

192
00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:22.287
- Giving up on me already?

193
00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:23.663
Hey.

194
00:07:23.664 --> 00:07:26.707
Hey.

195
00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:27.749
- I didn't hear from you.

196
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.625
- I know. I'm late.

197
00:07:29.626 --> 00:07:31.919
I was at work with my family.

198
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.172
It won't happen again.

199
00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:37.174
Please.

200
00:07:37.175 --> 00:07:38.799
- Everything okay
with your family?


201
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.343
- Yeah. You know, just some...

202
00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:42.719
work stuff.

203
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.887
- You guys run a
bar together, right?


204
00:07:43.888 --> 00:07:46.257
- Yeah.
- That must be a lot.


205
00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:48.265
- How do you mean?

206
00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:50.350
- Mixing family and business?

207
00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:51.726
Not always the best cocktail,

208
00:07:51.727 --> 00:07:53.019
at least where I'm from.

209
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.939
- Yeah, it, um, gets
messy sometimes.


210
00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:00.025
What about you?

211
00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:02.070
I don't think I ever
got a straight answer


212
00:08:02.095 --> 00:08:03.444
about what it is
you do for a living.


213
00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:04.987
- You didn't?

214
00:08:04.988 --> 00:08:06.237
- I didn't.

215
00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:09.699
- Um, I'm a data analyst
at a logistics firm.


216
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.325
It's more exciting than it...
- What exactly...


217
00:08:11.326 --> 00:08:12.618
- Hmm?

218
00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:14.702
- Go ahead.
- No, no, please.


219
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.205
- I don't know
exactly what that is,


220
00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:20.457
but is that something
you always wanted to do?


221
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.334
- Mm, not really.

222
00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:26.378
Uh, I got recruited,
actually, after Stanford.


223
00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:27.755
- Wow. Stanford.

224
00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:28.963
Big shot.

225
00:08:28.964 --> 00:08:30.006
- Where did you go?

226
00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:31.841
To college, I mean.

227
00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:33.300
- I didn't.

228
00:08:42.642 --> 00:08:43.710
This is weird.

229
00:08:43.735 --> 00:08:45.182
- Super weird.

230
00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:47.526
- You know, on the plus side,
at least we're not those two.


231
00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:55.567
- He just got dumped.
- Hm.


232
00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:56.902
- Mm.

233
00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.904
She said she needs
to find herself,


234
00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.405
but really, she's just bored.

235
00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:02.615
- It's a neat trick.

236
00:09:02.616 --> 00:09:04.534
- I like to people watch.

237
00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:06.409
And, well...

238
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.536
- Kept you waiting.

239
00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:09.496
- Yeah, you did.

240
00:09:17.086 --> 00:09:18.377
Do you wanna get out of here?

241
00:09:18.378 --> 00:09:19.837
- Absolutely.

258
00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:07.875
U.S. Senate, huh?

259
00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:09.208
- Yeah.

260
00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.419
He's running for
my dad's old seat.


261
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.758
- Wow.

262
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.672
How do they feel about you

Hey, you, um... rain check?

264
00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:32.351
Yeah?

265
00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:33.769
- Yeah.

266
00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:45.695
- Who are you?

267
00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:48.656
- I'm Emma. I live here.

268
00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:50.782
Who are you?
- Oh.


269
00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.493
I'm David's new
campaign manager, Doug.


270
00:10:53.494 --> 00:10:55.194
- Don't worry.
She's not a spy.


271
00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:56.288
Pizza?

272
00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:57.538
- Yeah.

273
00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:58.914
I'm starving.

274
00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:00.665
- Emma, darling,
where have you been?


275
00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:02.042
It's almost 10:00.

276
00:11:02.043 --> 00:11:03.584
- Uh, you know what they say:

277
00:11:03.585 --> 00:11:05.169
logistics never sleep.

278
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.837
- One day, you're gonna
have to explain to me


279
00:11:06.838 --> 00:11:08.922
what it is you actually do.

280
00:11:08.923 --> 00:11:10.465
- What's going on?
Everything okay?


281
00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:11.966
- My poll numbers just came in.

282
00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:14.259
- So you're throwing
a pizza party?


283
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.303
- Small bump in the
road. That's all.


284
00:11:16.304 --> 00:11:18.763
- Seems I'm underperforming
in the Seattle suburbs.


285
00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:20.097
- It's because he's unmarried.

286
00:11:20.098 --> 00:11:22.098
No one trusts a
senator who is single.


287
00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:24.017
- Sorry, Mom. I'll
see what I can do


288
00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:25.977
about finding a wife and
kids before the election.


289
00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:29.980
- I haven't seen
your mother like this


290
00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.773
since I ran for city council.

291
00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:34.275
I suppose you picked a tough
time to move back home.


292
00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:37.361
- Is there ever an easy
time for a 35-year-old


293
00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:38.820
to move back in
with her parents?


294
00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:40.260
- Sounds rhetorical.
Not touching it.


295
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:44.784
Look, I'm just
happy you're here.


296
00:11:47.244 --> 00:11:49.203
- Me too.

297
00:11:49.204 --> 00:11:51.288
And in a way, this is
how I think of home.


298
00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.415
Every six years, a hurricane
blew through our lives.


299
00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:55.541
- Yeah.

300
00:11:55.542 --> 00:11:56.751
Hurricane Grace.

301
00:11:56.752 --> 00:11:59.878
- This is a critical moment.

302
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.755
<i>- ♪ To all the women ♪</i>

303
00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:04.757
- Here you go, dear.

304
00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:06.203
- I'll take a mojito.

305
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:15.849
- Well, we don't serve mojitos.

306
00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:21.187
- Easy, Bird.

307
00:12:23.648 --> 00:12:24.857
I got it, Bird.

308
00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:26.900
Yeah.

309
00:12:31.028 --> 00:12:33.571
Sign language.

310
00:12:33.572 --> 00:12:35.990
That's not necessary.

311
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:37.616
- Well, I just
wanted to make sure


312
00:12:37.617 --> 00:12:39.367
I was being understood.

313
00:12:39.368 --> 00:12:43.662
After all, $15 million
is a lot of money.


314
00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:45.080
- Hey, we're figuring that out.

315
00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:47.249
- When and how much?
- A couple of weeks.


316
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.500
Working on a score right
now that should put


317
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:50.936
a pretty healthy
dent in the debt.


318
00:12:50.961 --> 00:12:53.878
I'd say mid-six figures.

319
00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:58.007
- You have three days to
make your first payment.


320
00:12:58.008 --> 00:12:59.883
- Look, I'm not getting myself

321
00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:01.635
or my family picked
up just to make good


322
00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:04.137
on your payment schedule.

323
00:13:04.138 --> 00:13:06.304
- Hm.

324
00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:09.975
Try explaining that to
Patrick Maguire's son, Connor.


325
00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:11.517
You remember, the
guy you ripped off,


326
00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:15.021
whose father is now
locked up, thanks to you?


327
00:13:15.022 --> 00:13:17.689
Get me my money by
the end of the week


328
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.076
or I'm calling Connor
to help collect.


329
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.493
- Well, breaking into
the house is easy.


330
00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:36.036
Breaking into this thing...

331
00:13:36.037 --> 00:13:38.038
- Wait, Pop, how did
you get the schematics


332
00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.498
to the ambassador's safe?

333
00:13:39.499 --> 00:13:42.043
- Stas works for the
company that installed it.


334
00:13:42.044 --> 00:13:43.878
- Who's Stas?
- Stas?


335
00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:45.213
He's an old friend of your dad.

336
00:13:45.214 --> 00:13:46.548
- We worked together
back at the steel mill.


337
00:13:46.549 --> 00:13:48.091
- I always loved Stas.

338
00:13:48.092 --> 00:13:49.197
He was so sweet.

339
00:13:49.222 --> 00:13:50.265
- I don't suppose he
happened to give you


340
00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:51.276
the code for the safe?

341
00:13:51.301 --> 00:13:53.574
- I wish.
- It's biometric,


342
00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.391
opened only with the
owner's thumbprint.


343
00:13:55.392 --> 00:13:56.892
- You know what? I
bet Stas would give us


344
00:13:56.893 --> 00:13:59.270
a thumb, too, if we asked.

345
00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:00.814
- That's Ma with the big ideas.

346
00:14:00.815 --> 00:14:01.917
We're not cutting
off anyone's thumb.


347
00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:02.949
- Suit yourself.

348
00:14:02.974 --> 00:14:05.485
- Wait, so we can't
get into the safe


349
00:14:05.486 --> 00:14:07.070
to steal the necklace.

350
00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:08.447
I mean, we're just gonna
have to flush it out.


351
00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:11.242
I think we pull a
modified green goods scam.


352
00:14:11.243 --> 00:14:13.244
- Is three days enough
time for a job this big?


353
00:14:13.245 --> 00:14:15.330
- It's not entirely impossible.

354
00:14:15.331 --> 00:14:18.550
Remember the cruise ship job?

355
00:14:18.575 --> 00:14:20.013
- You know, at least
the extraction plan


356
00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:21.629
wouldn't involve swimming.

357
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.464
- You guys are never
gonna forgive me


358
00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:25.758
for forgetting to refuel
those Jet Skis, are you?


359
00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:27.051
- No.
- No. Absolutely not.


360
00:14:27.052 --> 00:14:28.218
- Okay. Okay.

361
00:14:28.219 --> 00:14:30.388
So... so how do we
get the Ellsworths


362
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:32.057
to take their necklace
out of the safe?


363
00:14:32.058 --> 00:14:33.725
- You prey on their vanity.

364
00:14:33.726 --> 00:14:35.211
You guys saw those people.

365
00:14:35.236 --> 00:14:37.312
<i>The only thing that they
care more about than money</i>


366
00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:38.396
<i>is their image.</i>

367
00:14:38.397 --> 00:14:39.731
You just gotta give them

368
00:14:39.732 --> 00:14:41.400
an excuse to peacock.

369
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:43.361
- This sounds like
a job for Milos.


370
00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:44.987
- I thought we retired Milos.
- No.


371
00:14:44.988 --> 00:14:48.157
You retired Milos
because you were jealous.


372
00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:49.575
- Jealous?
- Yeah, jealous.


373
00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:51.453
- Of you wanting to
make a fool of yourself?


374
00:14:51.454 --> 00:14:52.871
- Are you kidding me?

375
00:14:52.872 --> 00:14:54.414
- Hey, guys, how about we focus?

376
00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:56.041
- Yeah, sorry.
- Sorry, baby.


377
00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:58.461
- You know, I don't entirely
hate Milos for this job.


378
00:15:00.214 --> 00:15:01.547
- Charlie.

379
00:15:01.548 --> 00:15:03.091
Don't encourage him.

380
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.138
<i>- this early in the
election cycle...</i>


381
00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:10.307
- Morning.

382
00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:11.642
- Oh, no, honey.

383
00:15:11.643 --> 00:15:13.686
You gotta wear something
dressier than that.


384
00:15:13.687 --> 00:15:15.229
- Why? I'm headed to work.

385
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.409
- Well, sure,

386
00:15:16.434 --> 00:15:18.273
but right after the
photographer snaps


387
00:15:18.274 --> 00:15:20.318
a few family shots for
David's new campaign.


388
00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:21.611
- Didn't you hear?

389
00:15:21.612 --> 00:15:22.904
Mom's rebranding us as

390
00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:24.656
the next great
political dynasty.


391
00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.241
We're the Asian
American Kennedys.


392
00:15:26.242 --> 00:15:29.494
- I prefer to think of them
as the Irish American Hills.


393
00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:30.663
That's good.

394
00:15:30.664 --> 00:15:32.039
Oh, we gotta remember

395
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.080
to put that in the memoir.

396
00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:36.502
- Don't ask.

397
00:15:36.503 --> 00:15:39.672
- While a photo shoot
sounds super fun,


398
00:15:39.673 --> 00:15:41.883
I'm not interested
in being a prop.


399
00:15:41.884 --> 00:15:43.260
- We're all props, dear.

400
00:15:43.261 --> 00:15:44.803
It's politics.

401
00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:46.930
- You want me to help? Fine.

402
00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:48.473
David doesn't have
a suburban problem.


403
00:15:48.474 --> 00:15:49.933
See these zip codes?

404
00:15:49.934 --> 00:15:51.602
They're all predominantly
Asian American.


405
00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:53.479
- That jives with
our numbers on, uh,


406
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.898
your authenticity factor.

407
00:15:55.899 --> 00:15:57.692
- They don't think
I'm Asian enough?


408
00:15:57.693 --> 00:15:59.944
- What if you wear a
hanbok for the photos?


409
00:15:59.945 --> 00:16:01.196
- It's a little
on the nose, Mom.


410
00:16:01.197 --> 00:16:02.489
- The Kennedys never wore kilts.

411
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.532
- I'm leaving.

412
00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:04.783
You're welcome.

413
00:16:04.784 --> 00:16:06.064
- The Kennedys weren't Scottish.

414
00:16:08.621 --> 00:16:10.415
- I don't like it, Charlie.

415
00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:12.208
The risks that she's
forcing us to take.


416
00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:13.693
- Look, you don't have
to be a part of this


417
00:16:13.717 --> 00:16:14.884
if you don't want to.

418
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:16.212
Paying Daphne back
is on me, all right?


419
00:16:16.213 --> 00:16:18.214
I messed that one up.

420
00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:19.549
- You're such a drama queen.

421
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.760
Just because I don't
like it does not mean


422
00:16:20.784 --> 00:16:22.344
I'm bailing on you.

423
00:16:22.345 --> 00:16:23.971
It's not like you're
the first Nicoletti


424
00:16:23.972 --> 00:16:25.556
to get blinded by love.

425
00:16:25.557 --> 00:16:27.349
At least you didn't marry Tina.

426
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.935
- At least Simon didn't
take us for $10 mil.


427
00:16:29.936 --> 00:16:33.064
- Tina conned me too.

428
00:16:33.065 --> 00:16:34.649
I don't know, I
think I wanted, like,


429
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.943
at least one of us to
have what Mom and Dad do.


430
00:16:36.944 --> 00:16:39.196
- Yeah, it's annoying how
high they set the bar, huh?


431
00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:42.950
- Well, you know, at
least we got each other.


432
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:44.410
I mean, just
realistically speaking.


433
00:16:44.411 --> 00:16:46.121
- You think so?
- Yeah.


434
00:17:07.853 --> 00:17:08.937
- Kid's got skills.

435
00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:09.938
- Don't.

436
00:17:13.485 --> 00:17:14.738
- What's this?

437
00:17:14.763 --> 00:17:16.070
- It's the hotel where
Daphne's staying.


438
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:18.489
I followed her home.

439
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.616
No one messes with my kid.

440
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.494
- So she knows our
vulnerabilities,


441
00:17:22.495 --> 00:17:23.829
it's only fair we
know hers, right?


442
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.789
- That's it right there.

443
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.500
Hey, what happened to my scarf?

444
00:17:28.501 --> 00:17:31.629
Okay,
I thought we said 3:00.


445
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:32.771
- Did you mean today, Milos?

446
00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:34.048
- Well, I'm here.

447
00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:35.424
- I can get you in as
soon as I'm through


448
00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:36.467
with Mrs. Ellsworth.

449
00:17:36.468 --> 00:17:37.802
- Lucky for you, Sandy,

450
00:17:37.803 --> 00:17:39.428
those magical hands of yours

451
00:17:39.429 --> 00:17:41.181
are worth the wait.

452
00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:42.308
So I'll wait.

453
00:17:44.602 --> 00:17:45.602
- Oh, no.

454
00:17:45.603 --> 00:17:47.271
- What?

455
00:17:47.272 --> 00:17:50.023
What is it?

456
00:17:50.024 --> 00:17:52.402
- General Petraeus and
his wife just canceled.


457
00:17:52.403 --> 00:17:54.154
Food poisoning.

458
00:17:54.155 --> 00:17:56.364
- And to think I could
have been at Fashion Week.


459
00:17:56.365 --> 00:17:57.824
- What about the Obamas?

460
00:17:57.825 --> 00:18:00.451
- Out of town.
- The AG and his wife?


461
00:18:00.452 --> 00:18:02.329
- I'd rather shoot
a bowl of dog food.


462
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.789
- Oh, God. There
must be someone.


463
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.499
- Who? A power
couple with a home


464
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.710
worthy of an arts and style page

465
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:09.170
in less than 24 hours?

466
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:11.046
I doubt it.

467
00:18:11.047 --> 00:18:13.758
- I don't mean to eavesdrop,
but I think I might know


468
00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.594
the perfect home:

469
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:16.720
mine.

470
00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:24.563
- Maintenance.

471
00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:28.483
How's that code coming?

472
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.863
- Just a second.

473
00:18:33.323 --> 00:18:34.866
Any luck?

474
00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:44.335
- I'm in.

475
00:18:51.008 --> 00:18:52.593
How long ago did you
say she checked in?


476
00:18:52.594 --> 00:18:54.178
- A week ago, and
housekeeping says


477
00:18:54.179 --> 00:18:55.888
Daphne hasn't let
anyone in since.


478
00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:57.223
- You wouldn't know.

479
00:18:57.224 --> 00:18:58.933
Place is spotless.

480
00:18:58.934 --> 00:19:00.810
<i>God, this woman is a robot.</i>

481
00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:19.330
Clever.

482
00:19:19.331 --> 00:19:21.500
Clever, clever, clever.

483
00:19:28.049 --> 00:19:30.425
Location number six,
Wednesday, 9:00 a. m.,


484
00:19:30.426 --> 00:19:32.053
Mr. C. Location number...

485
00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:35.265
This whole thing is encrypted.

486
00:19:35.266 --> 00:19:36.599
- Disciplined and paranoid.

487
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.142
That's perfect.

488
00:19:43.233 --> 00:19:44.358
- Oh, hang on a minute.

489
00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:45.485
Hang on a minute.

490
00:19:46.528 --> 00:19:47.696
Look at this.

491
00:19:49.864 --> 00:19:51.282
I'm sending you
something right now.


492
00:19:54.453 --> 00:19:56.413
See a resemblance?

493
00:19:56.414 --> 00:19:58.081
- I'm guessing that's her mom.

494
00:19:58.082 --> 00:20:00.208
- At least we know she's human.

495
00:20:02.629 --> 00:20:04.213
She's here.
- What?


496
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:20.022
<i>- I'm in. You copy?</i>

497
00:20:20.023 --> 00:20:21.481
- I copy.

498
00:20:31.618 --> 00:20:32.786
<i>- What's going on, Charlie?</i>

499
00:20:32.787 --> 00:20:34.414
Charlie.

500
00:21:30.392 --> 00:21:31.684
<i>Housekeeping!</i>

501
00:21:34.063 --> 00:21:35.147
Housekeeping.

502
00:21:37.209 --> 00:21:39.503
Okay, Charlie, get to the door
of the adjoining suite, now.


503
00:21:54.137 --> 00:21:55.451
<i>- Where'd you rush off to?</i>

504
00:21:55.452 --> 00:21:56.966
<i>Second date?</i>

505
00:21:56.967 --> 00:21:59.258
- Uh, we didn't
eat, so technically,


506
00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:00.925
it doesn't count as a date.

507
00:22:00.926 --> 00:22:03.466
Well, technically,

508
00:22:03.467 --> 00:22:05.883
anything more than two dates
means that you have to report


509
00:22:05.884 --> 00:22:07.716
an external contact form.

510
00:22:07.717 --> 00:22:10.633
<i>Update your relationship status.</i>

511
00:22:10.634 --> 00:22:13.299
- It's not a relationship.

512
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.257
<i>- Company rules, not mine.</i>

513
00:22:15.258 --> 00:22:17.007
- I don't know what it is.

514
00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:20.424
It's... it's like you
said. It's a rebound.


515
00:22:20.425 --> 00:22:22.257
- This is why I only
have one-night stands.


516
00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:23.673
<i>You don't want them
getting all clingy,</i>


517
00:22:23.674 --> 00:22:25.090
<i>asking you about your family,</i>

518
00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:27.298
<i>tell you their life story.</i>

519
00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:32.256
<i>Are you hearing me?</i>

520
00:22:32.257 --> 00:22:33.673
- I'm hanging up now.

521
00:22:46.862 --> 00:22:49.380
- Oh, boy, didn't even make it
into the restaurant this time.


522
00:22:49.381 --> 00:22:51.589
- See what happens
when you're on time?


523
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.014
- Yeah, well, eventually,
we're gonna have to upgrade


524
00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:55.464
to someplace with walls.

525
00:22:55.465 --> 00:22:56.756
- Gonna have to be your place,

526
00:22:56.757 --> 00:23:00.005
'cause I live with my parents.

527
00:23:00.006 --> 00:23:02.047
- Hey, how's that
going, by the way?


528
00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:05.589
I mean, living with your family
after being away for so long.


529
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.671
- It's, uh, not
without its challenges.


530
00:23:07.672 --> 00:23:10.130
- Oh, yeah? How so?

531
00:23:10.131 --> 00:23:12.880
Your folks are anything like
mine, made for each other,


532
00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:14.421
stupid in love?

533
00:23:16.172 --> 00:23:19.296
- Look, we don't
need to do this.


534
00:23:22.297 --> 00:23:24.020
- Do what?

535
00:23:24.045 --> 00:23:26.487
- Put pressure on this to be
anything more than what it is.


536
00:23:28.506 --> 00:23:31.670
- I'm sorry. What is this?

537
00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:34.296
- Two emotionally
unavailable people


538
00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:36.420
with a strong
physical connection


539
00:23:36.421 --> 00:23:37.754
clearly on the rebound.

540
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:43.462
Come on, Charlie.

541
00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:45.295
We met and hooked
up within hours


542
00:23:45.296 --> 00:23:47.629
of our last
relationships blowing up.


543
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.420
You don't think this
is all a bit fast?


544
00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:51.253
- No, I...

545
00:23:51.254 --> 00:23:53.462
I think sometimes you
meet the right person


546
00:23:53.463 --> 00:23:54.586
at the wrong time.

547
00:23:54.587 --> 00:23:57.170
Where is all this coming from?

548
00:23:57.171 --> 00:23:58.878
- I'm just calling
it like it is.


549
00:23:58.879 --> 00:24:00.711
- No, I... I think you're
throwing a grenade into this


550
00:24:00.712 --> 00:24:01.711
because you're scared.

551
00:24:01.712 --> 00:24:04.336
Tell me I'm wrong.

552
00:24:04.337 --> 00:24:07.085
Believe me, I know that trick.

553
00:24:11.795 --> 00:24:14.669
- I get that you think
you know me or whatever,


554
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.085
but the truth is, you don't.

555
00:24:17.086 --> 00:24:18.710
Don't pretend like you do.

556
00:24:27.294 --> 00:24:28.752
<i>- Okay, so step one:</i>

557
00:24:28.753 --> 00:24:30.293
<i>we infiltrate the Ellsworths</i>

558
00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:32.251
<i>by posing as a photography crew.</i>

559
00:24:32.252 --> 00:24:35.460
- There she is, my muse.

560
00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:37.460
- Get her out of here, Ludwig.

561
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:39.918
Unless the whole world wants
to see us covered in slobber.


562
00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:41.043
<i>- ♪ Every time
I try to speak ♪</i>


563
00:24:41.044 --> 00:24:43.127
<i>♪ I wanna tell you
that I dig you ♪</i>


564
00:24:45.294 --> 00:24:47.418
<i>♪ But every time I try ♪</i>

565
00:24:48.502 --> 00:24:50.627
- Milos, we're losing the light.

566
00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:54.250
- Right this way, Madam.

567
00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:55.959
- If they're as vain
as we think they are,


568
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.834
Mrs. Ellsworth will
not be able to resist


569
00:24:57.835 --> 00:24:59.083
wearing the necklace.

570
00:24:59.084 --> 00:25:00.459
Step two: intercept it

571
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.833
between her neck and the safe.

572
00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.875
- Darling, don't
forget my necklace.


573
00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:08.292
- Given what I
paid, how could I?


574
00:25:08.293 --> 00:25:10.416
<i>- Now, Bird, you're gonna
be on hair and makeup.</i>


575
00:25:10.417 --> 00:25:12.125
<i>I want you to be the
one making the switch</i>


576
00:25:12.126 --> 00:25:13.724
<i>between the real
necklace and the ringer.</i>


577
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.583
- Here, let me.

578
00:25:17.584 --> 00:25:20.500
- You'll have to excuse
Ludwig, but I'm afraid


579
00:25:20.501 --> 00:25:22.791
that no one's allowed to
touch the necklace but us.


580
00:25:22.792 --> 00:25:24.500
- Insurance companies.

581
00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:26.292
Such a bore.
- Mm-hmm.


582
00:25:56.249 --> 00:25:58.332
- How's it going?

583
00:25:58.333 --> 00:25:59.956
Please tell me
you've got something.


584
00:25:59.957 --> 00:26:01.289
- Judging by the
tone of your voice,


585
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.773
I guess the date didn't go well.

586
00:26:05.082 --> 00:26:07.331
Did you at least
get some action?


587
00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:09.164
- What do we have?

588
00:26:09.165 --> 00:26:11.456
- Uh, sadly, nothing.

589
00:26:11.457 --> 00:26:13.164
Not a single visitor
or a phone call.


590
00:26:13.165 --> 00:26:15.581
It's weird, actually.

591
00:26:15.582 --> 00:26:16.955
- What if Cas was right?

592
00:26:16.956 --> 00:26:18.580
Maybe they really
have gone dark.


593
00:26:18.581 --> 00:26:20.580
Maybe she's just here
tying up loose ends.


594
00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:22.331
- Yeah, 'cause the
only crime I'm seeing


595
00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:24.529
is someone as good-looking
at this woman with zero life.


596
00:26:26.748 --> 00:26:28.539
She's objectively attractive.

597
00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:31.831
- Emma, you've got a code green.

598
00:26:32.331 --> 00:26:33.747
- What?

599
00:26:33.748 --> 00:26:35.331
- Your brother.
He's in the lobby.


600
00:26:41.498 --> 00:26:43.371
- David, what a surprise.

601
00:26:43.372 --> 00:26:45.496
You should have called. I
could have met you somewhere.


602
00:26:45.497 --> 00:26:48.080
- I realized yesterday I've
never visited you at work.


603
00:26:50.413 --> 00:26:51.621
- Thank you for the coffee.

604
00:26:51.622 --> 00:26:53.871
It's just, I've
got this project,


605
00:26:53.872 --> 00:26:55.621
and now's really
not a good time.


606
00:26:55.622 --> 00:26:57.162
- Okay, yeah. I'll take off.

607
00:26:57.163 --> 00:27:01.870
I just... you know, I wanted
to talk to you about, um...


608
00:27:01.871 --> 00:27:03.989
Would you ever consider
coming to work on my campaign?


609
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:06.578
- What?

610
00:27:06.579 --> 00:27:08.329
- We need a new
campaign strategist,


611
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.453
and the way you cut
through the noise


612
00:27:09.454 --> 00:27:11.495
on my polling numbers,

613
00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:13.495
I thought...

614
00:27:13.496 --> 00:27:16.328
- David, I'm honored, but I...

615
00:27:16.329 --> 00:27:18.411
- Just... think about it.

616
00:27:18.412 --> 00:27:19.537
Okay?

617
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.911
- I'll think about it.

618
00:27:22.912 --> 00:27:25.369
I promise.

619
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.453
Thank you for the coffee.

620
00:27:27.454 --> 00:27:28.573
- Good luck on that project.

621
00:27:36.037 --> 00:27:38.785
- So how do we steal a
necklace we can't touch?


622
00:27:38.786 --> 00:27:40.660
- Not the way we planned.

623
00:27:40.661 --> 00:27:41.785
- Is it time to
cut off his thumb?


624
00:27:41.786 --> 00:27:44.993
- No, no, no. Just new plan.

625
00:27:44.994 --> 00:27:46.202
Catalina Jewel.
- Yeah.


626
00:27:46.203 --> 00:27:47.368
Oldie but goodie.
- Yeah.


627
00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:49.035
- Yes, yes. Chin down.

628
00:27:49.036 --> 00:27:50.493
Oh, yes.

629
00:27:50.494 --> 00:27:51.619
- Give me the ringer.

630
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.576
- Chin up. Chin up.

631
00:27:54.577 --> 00:27:56.327
Oh, look at each
other just like that.


632
00:27:56.328 --> 00:27:59.618
Nice. Beautiful.

633
00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:00.993
- Sorry. Touch ups.

634
00:28:00.994 --> 00:28:02.910
- What? What touch ups?

635
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:04.409
- I'm sorry. The
cuticle on his thumb


636
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.367
is driving me crazy. He
looks like a trucker.


637
00:28:06.368 --> 00:28:07.951
- Well, fix it. Yeah.

638
00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:09.992
Yeah. No truckers here.

639
00:28:09.993 --> 00:28:11.576
Okay. Oh.
- Right here.


640
00:28:11.577 --> 00:28:12.701
- Oh, it's hot.

641
00:28:12.702 --> 00:28:13.992
- I know, but it's so worth it.

642
00:28:13.993 --> 00:28:15.312
- Yes, another one
just like that.


643
00:28:16.993 --> 00:28:18.160
There we go.

644
00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:22.450
- What's wrong, Milos?

645
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:24.075
- It's the necklace.

646
00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:27.366
It distracts from your
stunning decolletage.


647
00:28:27.367 --> 00:28:28.408
- Oh.

648
00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:30.116
You heard the man, Claude.

649
00:28:30.117 --> 00:28:31.326
- Yes, of course.

650
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.325
- Yes. Yes.

651
00:28:35.326 --> 00:28:36.366
Gorgeous.

652
00:28:36.367 --> 00:28:37.617
I love it.

653
00:28:37.618 --> 00:28:40.283
Oh.

654
00:28:40.284 --> 00:28:41.824
Right there. Right.

655
00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:43.908
Right there.

656
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:45.283
- Hey, Milos.

657
00:28:45.284 --> 00:28:46.782
- Yeah.
- Step down two


658
00:28:46.783 --> 00:28:47.949
and test that for me.

659
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.617
- Well, o... okay.

660
00:28:53.992 --> 00:28:55.699
- What?
- My bad.


661
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.532
- So sorry that he
startled you, dear, but...


662
00:28:57.533 --> 00:28:58.865
Startled her.

663
00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:01.574
- I'm gonna go find a fuse box.

664
00:29:01.575 --> 00:29:03.407
- Yeah.

665
00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.656
Oh.

666
00:29:16.282 --> 00:29:19.865
- What the hell happened
with the lights?


667
00:29:19.866 --> 00:29:21.740
Something burning?

668
00:29:53.281 --> 00:29:54.529
- Hey.

669
00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.529
How are you?

670
00:29:57.572 --> 00:29:58.738
Whoa.

671
00:29:58.739 --> 00:29:59.946
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

672
00:30:02.072 --> 00:30:03.696
- Ludwig, I thought
I told you to keep


673
00:30:03.697 --> 00:30:05.362
Duchess out of the study.

674
00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:35.986
- I thought the
assistant was supposed


675
00:30:35.987 --> 00:30:37.736
to be fixing the fuse.

676
00:30:37.737 --> 00:30:38.778
- So did I.

677
00:30:41.446 --> 00:30:43.236
- You know, I think I'm lost.

678
00:30:43.237 --> 00:30:44.695
- Hands.

679
00:30:49.112 --> 00:30:50.277
- What are you doing in here?

680
00:30:50.278 --> 00:30:51.861
- I was looking
for the sub panel.


681
00:30:51.862 --> 00:30:53.403
- How stupid do you think I am?

682
00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.277
- Yeah, oh, okay.

683
00:30:58.278 --> 00:30:59.777
- What is this? What?

684
00:30:59.778 --> 00:31:01.735
Why are you touching
my assistant?


685
00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:03.776
- Caught him snooping
around in here.


686
00:31:03.777 --> 00:31:05.986
Well, you
guys do well for yourselves.


687
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.027
- He's clean.

688
00:31:09.028 --> 00:31:11.318
- Anyway, for the next shot,
I'm thinking staircase,


689
00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:12.735
I'm thinking shadows.

690
00:31:12.736 --> 00:31:13.902
- No, I'm sorry.

691
00:31:13.903 --> 00:31:15.318
There will be no more next shot.

692
00:31:15.319 --> 00:31:16.318
We're done here.

693
00:31:19.903 --> 00:31:21.776
- I'm so sorry, Milos.

694
00:31:21.777 --> 00:31:24.026
- No, no, no.

695
00:31:24.027 --> 00:31:26.359
It is your husband
who should apologize.


696
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.527
My next shot was going
to be my masterpiece.


697
00:31:32.277 --> 00:31:33.525
- Don't worry about it, Charlie.

698
00:31:33.526 --> 00:31:35.151
We will figure something out.

699
00:31:35.152 --> 00:31:38.400
Or Daphne can wait for
her first installment.


700
00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:41.275
- She's not gonna have to wait.

701
00:31:44.472 --> 00:31:45.751
Hi.

702
00:31:45.776 --> 00:31:46.864
Hi.

703
00:31:50.817 --> 00:31:52.692
- You sneaky bastard.

704
00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:56.317
- "A legacy you can count on."

705
00:31:56.318 --> 00:31:57.816
What does that even mean?

706
00:31:57.817 --> 00:31:59.524
- You're more than
a name, David.


707
00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:01.691
You are part of a
political dynasty.


708
00:32:01.692 --> 00:32:04.608
Plus, it tested through the
roof at the focus group.


709
00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:06.316
- Maybe that's the problem.

710
00:32:06.317 --> 00:32:07.774
- What are you talking about?

711
00:32:07.775 --> 00:32:09.733
- If David has an
authenticity problem,


712
00:32:09.734 --> 00:32:11.482
maybe it's because
you're trying to turn him


713
00:32:11.483 --> 00:32:13.691
into the candidate
who polls well


714
00:32:13.692 --> 00:32:16.316
instead of the candidate he is.

715
00:32:16.317 --> 00:32:19.357
- You know what they
say about idealism?


716
00:32:19.358 --> 00:32:21.900
It's impotent without realism.

717
00:32:26.025 --> 00:32:27.648
- Pretty sure she
just quoted Nixon.


718
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:30.231
Seems right.

719
00:32:30.232 --> 00:32:33.231
- Sorry about
ambushing you at work.


720
00:32:33.232 --> 00:32:34.523
- Don't be.

721
00:32:34.524 --> 00:32:37.523
It's just... Work's
been stressful.


722
00:32:37.524 --> 00:32:39.814
- I hear that.

723
00:32:39.815 --> 00:32:42.190
- I could use a drink.

724
00:32:42.191 --> 00:32:44.106
- Oh, come on. We
must have drank


725
00:32:44.107 --> 00:32:45.397
half their wine
collection as teenagers.


726
00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:47.190
How could they not have noticed?

727
00:32:47.191 --> 00:32:50.355
- Sometimes you see
what you wanna see.


728
00:32:50.356 --> 00:32:54.105
- Hey, thanks for
having my back earlier.


729
00:32:54.106 --> 00:32:56.480
And hey, if you decide
to come on board


730
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:58.060
as my campaign strategist...

731
00:32:58.085 --> 00:32:58.980
- David.

732
00:32:58.981 --> 00:33:00.314
- It's not just because
you're brilliant


733
00:33:00.315 --> 00:33:01.938
at making sense of
stuff no one else can.


734
00:33:01.939 --> 00:33:03.240
- You don't understand.
- It's because you're


735
00:33:03.264 --> 00:33:04.730
the one person in this family

736
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:06.315
who actually has my back.

737
00:33:18.647 --> 00:33:23.313
- David, I don't really
work for a logistics firm.


738
00:33:23.314 --> 00:33:25.730
I work for the
government, same as you.


739
00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:32.147
Pattern Logistics is
just a front for a...


740
00:33:33.396 --> 00:33:37.604
A highly secretive
government agency.


741
00:33:37.605 --> 00:33:38.771
- No way.

742
00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:41.854
- It's why I'm so private.

743
00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:45.730
Why I keep my compartments
so compartmentalized.


744
00:33:49.979 --> 00:33:52.396
- Thank you for telling me.

745
00:33:55.396 --> 00:33:57.394
This is nice, you letting me in.

746
00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:03.562
- And for the record, you
were always like this.


747
00:34:05.395 --> 00:34:07.103
Maybe you just found
a job that suited you.


748
00:34:11.936 --> 00:34:13.394
- Come on, sweetie.

749
00:34:13.395 --> 00:34:14.935
It was just part of the job.

750
00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:16.311
- Oh, yeah?

751
00:34:16.312 --> 00:34:18.060
You're gonna really
stand there and tell me


752
00:34:18.061 --> 00:34:20.977
you didn't enjoy having
her fawning all over you?


753
00:34:20.978 --> 00:34:22.019
- I didn't say that.

754
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.144
I said it was just
part of the job.


755
00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:26.019
Come on. Come on.

756
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.602
Hey, it's not my
fault. I still got it.


757
00:34:28.603 --> 00:34:30.351
- Hey, did she go
down without a fuss?


758
00:34:30.352 --> 00:34:31.810
- Yeah, mostly. Hey, Pop,

759
00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:33.602
you gotta stop teaching her

760
00:34:33.603 --> 00:34:34.810
the sleight of hand stuff, okay?

761
00:34:34.811 --> 00:34:36.851
Kid lifted my wallet... again.

762
00:34:36.852 --> 00:34:38.393
- Good job with Duchess.

763
00:34:38.394 --> 00:34:39.476
- Yeah.

764
00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:40.796
Sniffed that one out quick, huh?

765
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:41.851
- Hey, guys.

766
00:34:41.852 --> 00:34:43.642
I think we have a problem.

767
00:34:43.643 --> 00:34:45.684
The diamond in the
necklace we just stole


768
00:34:45.685 --> 00:34:47.350
is already stolen.

769
00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:48.392
- What?

770
00:34:48.393 --> 00:34:50.809
- So it's called
the Black Orlov,


771
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.309
and it was stolen
from a Hindu temple


772
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.934
back in the 19th century.

773
00:34:54.935 --> 00:34:56.767
It's changed hands a bunch
of times throughout history.


774
00:34:56.768 --> 00:34:58.559
- And now it's ended up in ours.

775
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.179
- Yeah, but how are
we supposed to fence


776
00:35:00.204 --> 00:35:01.225
a stolen diamond?

777
00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:03.017
- I don't know what
we're talking about.


778
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:05.100
Daphne's expecting
mid-six figures.


779
00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:07.225
This necklace is the
only thing we've got.


780
00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:09.600
- No, what we've got
is a stolen antiquity.


781
00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:11.100
It is legit priceless,

782
00:35:11.101 --> 00:35:13.059
but like Ma said,
we can't sell it.


783
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:19.892
- Okay, what if there's a way

784
00:35:19.893 --> 00:35:21.974
that we can have our
cake and eat it too?


785
00:35:21.975 --> 00:35:23.932
- Yeah? What are you thinking?

786
00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:30.974
- You.

787
00:35:30.975 --> 00:35:32.348
- You looking for a necklace?

788
00:35:38.527 --> 00:35:40.425
- Where is the real one?

789
00:35:40.426 --> 00:35:41.885
- It's safe.

790
00:35:41.886 --> 00:35:43.344
- I can't believe this.
- What,


791
00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:44.596
that I stole your necklace

792
00:35:44.597 --> 00:35:46.724
or that I'm here to
sell it back to you?


793
00:35:46.725 --> 00:35:48.642
Honestly, this is
not how I thought


794
00:35:48.643 --> 00:35:50.102
it was gonna go down.

795
00:35:50.103 --> 00:35:54.273
But once I realized that
it was actually stolen...


796
00:35:54.274 --> 00:35:55.900
- It wasn't stolen.

797
00:35:55.901 --> 00:35:57.359
It was a gift.

798
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.012
- A gift? Hm.

799
00:36:00.037 --> 00:36:02.407
You know, last I checked, gifts
aren't normally laundered.


800
00:36:02.408 --> 00:36:04.492
But you know, gift,
bribe, tomayto, tomahto,


801
00:36:04.493 --> 00:36:06.328
whatever you wanna call it.

802
00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:09.790
What your Russian oligarch
pal failed to mention


803
00:36:09.791 --> 00:36:12.752
was that that
necklace is actually


804
00:36:12.753 --> 00:36:14.962
a plundered cultural artifact,
one the Indian government


805
00:36:14.963 --> 00:36:19.008
has been looking for
for quite a while now.


806
00:36:19.009 --> 00:36:20.551
- What are you talking about?

807
00:36:20.552 --> 00:36:22.638
- Oh, come on. You
know the story.


808
00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:27.935
Colonialism, greed, corruption.

809
00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:30.103
I mean, it's funny, isn't it?

810
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:34.609
How... how everything changes,
then yet nothing changes.


811
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.861
- Everything is stolen.

812
00:36:36.862 --> 00:36:38.821
All that matters
is who has it last.


813
00:36:38.822 --> 00:36:40.073
- Wow.

814
00:36:40.074 --> 00:36:42.408
You should use that
in the article.


815
00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:43.451
- What article?

816
00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.415
- "The Washington Post."

817
00:36:49.334 --> 00:36:51.001
They were very
moved by your offer


818
00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:53.629
to return the diamond
to the rightful owner.


819
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.673
Oh, I should probably mention.

820
00:36:55.674 --> 00:36:57.630
Got a hold of the
Indian ambassador.


821
00:36:57.655 --> 00:36:58.802
Yeah.

822
00:36:58.803 --> 00:37:00.283
She should be here
any moment as well.


823
00:37:05.893 --> 00:37:07.352
How much do you want?

824
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:15.278
<i>- Money's just money, right?</i>

825
00:37:15.279 --> 00:37:17.989
<i>No, the only thing truly
priceless to a person like you</i>


826
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.158
<i>is your sparkling reputation.</i>

827
00:37:22.412 --> 00:37:25.038
<i>So you can either be a hero</i>

828
00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:30.294
<i>who returns a plundered
cultural artifact,</i>


829
00:37:30.295 --> 00:37:33.590
or you can let the world
see exactly who you are.


830
00:37:52.485 --> 00:37:53.485
Hey.

831
00:37:53.486 --> 00:37:55.280
<i>- Hey.</i>

832
00:37:55.281 --> 00:38:00.827
I'm sorry about what I said
about this being a rebound.


833
00:38:00.828 --> 00:38:02.245
I didn't mean it.

834
00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.206
- Well, it had to
come from somewhere.


835
00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:09.211
- I'm not good at this...

836
00:38:09.212 --> 00:38:15.468
at letting people in, letting
people see the real me.


837
00:38:15.469 --> 00:38:17.386
- Hey, look, I
get it, all right?


838
00:38:17.387 --> 00:38:18.930
More than you know.

839
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:21.933
<i>- With you, there is no hiding.</i>

840
00:38:21.934 --> 00:38:23.769
It's not just that
you see me, Charlie.


841
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:27.272
Sometimes it feels like
you can see through me.


842
00:38:27.273 --> 00:38:29.733
And that's...

843
00:38:29.734 --> 00:38:32.654
Scary.

844
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.165
- Why?

845
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.409
- Because you might be the
only person in the world


846
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.787
who does.

847
00:38:45.377 --> 00:38:46.883
- Well, good morning.

848
00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:48.796
- If you're going to ask
me about the relationship


849
00:38:48.797 --> 00:38:49.963
status form...

850
00:38:49.964 --> 00:38:51.500
- You were right about Daphne.

851
00:38:55.513 --> 00:38:57.222
<i>- Move up the plan.</i>

852
00:38:57.223 --> 00:38:59.015
<i>Have your men
ready for delivery,</i>


853
00:38:59.016 --> 00:39:01.518
<i>9:00 tomorrow
night at the port.</i>


854
00:39:01.519 --> 00:39:03.559
- So do you wanna reach out
to the FBI, or should I?


855
00:39:16.743 --> 00:39:18.245
- You have something for me?

856
00:39:18.246 --> 00:39:21.374
- Uh, as a matter
of fact, we do.


857
00:39:23.042 --> 00:39:24.710
We now serve mojitos.

858
00:39:28.339 --> 00:39:30.660
- And I think the words you're
looking for are "thank you."


859
00:39:35.472 --> 00:39:37.265
- You don't even wanna count it?

860
00:39:37.266 --> 00:39:39.517
- Judging by the
weight, I'd say you have


861
00:39:39.518 --> 00:39:42.646
roughly $14.5 million to go.

862
00:39:42.647 --> 00:39:44.106
But here's to a good start.

863
00:39:44.107 --> 00:39:46.024
- Oh, that's... I like that.

864
00:39:46.025 --> 00:39:49.570
That's... yeah.

865
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:52.657
- So we will do your bidding.

866
00:39:52.658 --> 00:39:54.534
But I would be grateful
if you would leave


867
00:39:54.535 --> 00:39:56.578
my daughter out of it.

868
00:39:56.579 --> 00:39:59.497
Whatever ASL night school
classes you signed up for,


869
00:39:59.498 --> 00:40:01.458
maybe it's time to drop them.

870
00:40:08.049 --> 00:40:10.468
- You know, my
mother used to say,


871
00:40:10.469 --> 00:40:12.636
the only thing more dangerous

872
00:40:12.637 --> 00:40:15.389
than a man with nothing to lose

873
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.392
is a single mom with
everything to prove.


874
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.241
- You wanna give the
order, or should I?


875
00:40:32.242 --> 00:40:34.285
- You know the drill, Vic.

876
00:40:34.286 --> 00:40:36.038
- Right. You were never here.

877
00:40:37.247 --> 00:40:38.749
Cut it.

878
00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:49.427
- We're clear.
- Clear.


879
00:40:55.476 --> 00:40:56.476
- Where's the shipment?

880
00:40:59.271 --> 00:41:00.730
- Is that...

881
00:41:00.731 --> 00:41:01.941
- The bug we planted.

882
00:41:03.318 --> 00:41:05.152
- Damn. She played us.

883
00:41:05.153 --> 00:41:06.529
- No.

884
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.781
She made us.

885
00:41:14.747 --> 00:41:16.540
- Thanks.

886
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:18.166
- Ah, Cliffs of Moher.

887
00:41:18.167 --> 00:41:20.752
I haven't seen those
since our honeymoon.


888
00:41:20.753 --> 00:41:22.295
- Wait. Hold on a second.

889
00:41:22.296 --> 00:41:24.965
You and Mom were in
Ireland on your honeymoon.


890
00:41:24.966 --> 00:41:27.385
You're telling me that Cliffs
of Moher... this is Ireland?


891
00:41:27.386 --> 00:41:29.136
- Last I checked.

892
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.976
She's his daughter.

893
00:41:34.977 --> 00:41:38.730
Daphne is Patrick
Maguire's daughter.


894
00:41:38.731 --> 00:41:40.649
- So, Pop, that's why
he trusts her, right?


895
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.150
And that's why someone like her

896
00:41:42.151 --> 00:41:43.569
rises up through the
ranks so quickly.


897
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.279
I wonder why they're
keeping it a secret.


898
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.947
- I don't know, but
I think we just found


899
00:41:46.948 --> 00:41:48.365
our vulnerability.

900
00:41:48.366 --> 00:41:49.785
<i>- Sláinte.</i>
- Mm-hmm.


901
00:41:57.126 --> 00:41:59.210
<i>- I know who our enemy is.</i>

902
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:00.878
<i>Emma Hill.</i>

903
00:42:00.879 --> 00:42:02.673
I don't know which
agency she works for,


904
00:42:02.674 --> 00:42:04.758
but considering they
planted an illegal bug,


905
00:42:04.759 --> 00:42:07.011
my guess is, it's not the FBI.

906
00:42:07.012 --> 00:42:10.639
<i>In 72 hours, I brought
in $1/2 million in cash</i>


907
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.099
without selling an
ounce of fentanyl,


908
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.852
and I've managed to
identify the woman


909
00:42:13.853 --> 00:42:15.062
who wants to take us down.

910
00:42:16.939 --> 00:42:18.648
Now do you believe
I have what it takes
