<i>Previously
on "The Company You Keep"...</i>


2
00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:04.314
- You must be Emma.
- This is my mom.


3
00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:07.011
- Fran. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.


4
00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:08.401
<i>I mean, my dad's
startin' to slip</i>


5
00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:11.029
- a little bit.
- That sounds brutal.


6
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.673
Yeah, it is.

7
00:00:12.674 --> 00:00:15.575
<i>David, this is Claire Fox.</i>

8
00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:16.868
<i>We should talk.</i>

9
00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.411
<i>I'm not who you think I am.</i>

10
00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:20.496
How can Daphne make
such a big payment


11
00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:22.623
if she's selling their product
at bargain basement prices?


12
00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:24.584
She's not selling off
to get out.


13
00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.627
<i>She's currying favor
with rivals,</i>


14
00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:29.172
<i>which means she's building
something even bigger.</i>


15
00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:31.841
I'm not gettin' myself
or my family picked up


16
00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.177
just to make good
on your payment schedule.


17
00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:35.887
Try explaining that to Connor.

18
00:00:35.888 --> 00:00:37.263
You remember
the guy you ripped off


19
00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:39.682
whose father is now locked up,
thanks to you?


20
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:41.351
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that your sister's


21
00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:42.977
takin' a run at your crown.

22
00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:44.395
I don't have a sister.

23
00:00:44.396 --> 00:00:45.606
<i>Sure about that?</i>

24
00:01:02.493 --> 00:01:04.874
What is this?

25
00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:06.460
We just have a few questions.

26
00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.538
<i>Who exactly has a few questions?</i>

27
00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:11.748
What the hell, Cas?

28
00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:13.750
Was a black bag
seriously necessary?


29
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:16.252
His background report
turned up a big ol' red flag


30
00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.630
and we need to protect you
and the agency.


31
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:20.256
He's hiding something, Emma.

32
00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:21.875
We need to find out what.

33
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.294
<i>"May 2013.</i>

34
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.201
<i>"Passport stamped in Nicaragua.</i>

35
00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:34.604
<i>Overstayed his visa."</i>

36
00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:36.523
- <i>Not a big deal.
- You get to the part</i>


37
00:01:36.524 --> 00:01:38.608
where he pops up
six months later


38
00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.985
at the Mexican border on foot?

39
00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:43.112
Eight months in Central America

40
00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:45.151
completely unaccounted
for and...


41
00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:48.785
He needs to account for it.

42
00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:49.986
Hands up.

43
00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:52.413
State your full name.

44
00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.791
Charles Francis Nicoletti.

45
00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:56.835
Do you own a bar?

46
00:01:56.836 --> 00:01:58.036
With my family, yeah.

47
00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:02.257
Are you currently
in a committed relationship?


48
00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:03.383
<i>Yes.</i>

49
00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:05.510
See? Not all bad.

50
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:07.011
<i>Have you ever traveled
out of the country?</i>


51
00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:08.471
<i>Yes.</i>

52
00:02:08.472 --> 00:02:10.014
Do you have
any additional passports


53
00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:11.224
other than the one issued to you

54
00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:12.684
by the United States?

55
00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:14.144
Have you ever worked
for a foreign government?


56
00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:16.438
Have you ever conspired
against the United States?


57
00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:18.731
<i>I'm a bartender, lady.</i>

58
00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:19.732
The only thing people ask me for

59
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:21.152
is another round.

60
00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:25.155
Did you know Emma Hill
is a CIA officer?


61
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.124
Did you know Emma Hill
is a CIA officer?


62
00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:38.752
I do now.

63
00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:41.297
<i>Are you upset
she didn't tell you?</i>


64
00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:44.425
<i>I'm sure she had her reasons.</i>

65
00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:51.849
Have you been
to Central America?


66
00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.854
This is about Nicaragua?

67
00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:01.524
Yes or no?

68
00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.533
<i>Yeah, um, in 2013.</i>

69
00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:12.119
<i>Why did you overstay your visa?</i>

70
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:18.918
<i>I was in prison.</i>

71
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:24.173
<i>I was with some friends.
We got into a fight.</i>


72
00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:27.300
<i>I punched a military official.</i>

73
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:29.341
<i>Landed me in Nicaraguan jail
for about seven months.</i>


74
00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:33.349
<i>Wasn't my best moment.</i>

75
00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:37.144
<i>Why didn't you tell
Ms. Hill about this incident?</i>


76
00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:42.483
I didn't want her
to think less of me.


77
00:03:45.903 --> 00:03:47.363
Now you know his secret.

78
00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:50.699
Yeah.

79
00:03:53.077 --> 00:03:54.995
<i>Just wonder
how he'll feel about mine.</i>


80
00:04:06.256 --> 00:04:07.174
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

81
00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:09.217
I... it's protocol.

82
00:04:09.218 --> 00:04:10.927
You have to declare
you're in a relationship,


83
00:04:10.928 --> 00:04:12.971
and then this red flag came up.

84
00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:15.765
And-and I figured there was
a simple explanation.


85
00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:17.976
This is not the way
that I wanted you to find out.


86
00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:19.102
I didn't know
they were going to do that.


87
00:04:19.103 --> 00:04:20.646
I swear.

88
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:23.398
I'm so sorry.

89
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:29.071
Charlie?

90
00:04:31.657 --> 00:04:33.491
Charlie?

91
00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:35.451
Charlie, are you okay?

92
00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:36.652
Yeah.

93
00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:40.373
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

94
00:04:40.374 --> 00:04:44.002
just processing.
It's kind of a lot.


95
00:04:44.003 --> 00:04:45.379
I know.

96
00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:49.215
The good news is you're cleared.

97
00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:52.636
You know my secret,
and now I know yours.


98
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.473
The whole prison thing,
I mean, look,


99
00:04:57.474 --> 00:05:00.018
just because you made
one mistake in Nicaragua


100
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:02.520
doesn't make you a bad guy.

101
00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:04.356
Right.

102
00:05:07.192 --> 00:05:09.736
- Are we good?
- Yeah.


103
00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:11.447
Yeah, of course.
No, we're good.


104
00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:15.658
We're good.

105
00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:24.542
One, two, three, four
on the vodka...


106
00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:26.085
Hey, there he is.
Where ya been?


107
00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:29.380
Where were you?
You were MIA for 12 hours.


108
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:31.299
You didn't respond
to our calls or texts.


109
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.468
Yeah. I was with Emma.

110
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:34.844
Okay, well, let us know

111
00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:36.471
if you're gonna be
out all night.


112
00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:38.181
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize at 40


113
00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:40.016
that I need permission.

114
00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:41.976
So next time I'll make sure
to run right home


115
00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:43.311
the second the streetlights
come on, okay?


116
00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:44.645
Hey, easy, easy, easy, easy.

117
00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:46.647
We-we found your bike
with the keys in it,


118
00:05:46.648 --> 00:05:48.524
and the lights were on.
We just... we got worried.


119
00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:49.567
The Maguires are breathin'

120
00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:51.361
- down our n... 'kay.
- Yeah, I get it.


121
00:05:51.362 --> 00:05:53.589
- Charlie...
- Hey, I-I get it.


122
00:05:57.326 --> 00:06:00.496
Look, I'm just... I'm tired.
I wanna go shower.


123
00:06:02.956 --> 00:06:03.998
I'm sorry I worried you.

124
00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.001
- I was worried.
- Yeah. Okay.


125
00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:18.096
Is everything okay in there?

126
00:06:18.097 --> 00:06:20.181
Yeah.

127
00:06:20.182 --> 00:06:23.101
I'm working on my, uh,
invite list for the fundraiser.


128
00:06:23.102 --> 00:06:25.812
Should I put you down
for plus one?


129
00:06:25.813 --> 00:06:27.939
You can't keep your mystery man
a mystery forever.


130
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.607
I know. But, um...

131
00:06:29.608 --> 00:06:31.401
now's just not the right time.

132
00:06:31.402 --> 00:06:33.569
Come on.
There's no such thing.


133
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.321
Plus, Mom and Dad'll be
on their best behavior,


134
00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:37.031
plenty of buffers.

135
00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:39.201
Best possible scenario
for what's his name again?


136
00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:43.621
- Charlie.
- Who's Charlie?


137
00:06:43.622 --> 00:06:46.624
You're welcome.
Uh, Emma's new boyfriend.


138
00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:48.334
I was telling her she should
bring him to the party.


139
00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:51.045
Uh, event. But yes.

140
00:06:51.046 --> 00:06:53.673
We'd love to meet the man
you've told us nothing about.


141
00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:56.008
- Seriously, bring him by.
- I'll ask.


142
00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.010
But no promises.

143
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.846
The new polling numbers
look strong.


144
00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:01.514
Donations are through the roof.

145
00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:03.141
I think we can officially say

146
00:07:03.142 --> 00:07:04.725
the campaign
has turned a corner.


147
00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:06.686
I'm proud of you, son.

148
00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.647
So who do we have here?

149
00:07:10.107 --> 00:07:11.358
Claire Fox?

150
00:07:12.568 --> 00:07:15.653
Uh, Doug put together the list.

151
00:07:15.654 --> 00:07:17.656
Half these donors
I don't even know.


152
00:07:18.657 --> 00:07:21.617
Well, trust me when I say

153
00:07:21.618 --> 00:07:24.537
her support
is not the kind you want.


154
00:07:24.538 --> 00:07:27.081
It always comes at a cost.

155
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.683
There she is.

156
00:07:46.894 --> 00:07:48.811
Is he dead?

157
00:07:48.812 --> 00:07:51.315
Aye, he wishes he was, yeah.

158
00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:55.902
What are you doing here?

159
00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:57.862
I'm cleanin' up your mess.

160
00:07:57.863 --> 00:07:59.697
Why the hell you meetin'
with our rivals?


161
00:07:59.698 --> 00:08:02.783
They're our partners now,
so you need to play nice.


162
00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:05.036
I have got a plan,
and they're a key part of it.


163
00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:07.122
So you had a wee plan,
so you did.


164
00:08:09.082 --> 00:08:11.083
I'm here, so we're doin' things
my way now.


165
00:08:11.084 --> 00:08:13.502
You being here is only gonna
bring us more heat.


166
00:08:13.503 --> 00:08:15.504
The feds
are already watching us.


167
00:08:15.505 --> 00:08:18.174
Your father trusts me
to handle things.


168
00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:21.552
Well, him trustin' you
doesn't mean piss all to me.


169
00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:23.304
And if you think that bein'
the boss' bastard's


170
00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:25.766
gonna get you a seat
at the table, sister...


171
00:08:27.643 --> 00:08:29.353
It won't.

172
00:08:37.194 --> 00:08:39.195
Feelin' better?

173
00:08:39.196 --> 00:08:40.404
I am.

174
00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:41.865
Wanna talk about it?

175
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:45.577
Okay.

176
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.913
You know, uh,
for what it's worth,


177
00:08:48.914 --> 00:08:51.708
Emma... I didn't hate her.

178
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.754
Oh, my God.
I liked her, okay?


179
00:08:56.755 --> 00:08:58.422
You talkin' Emma?

180
00:08:58.423 --> 00:09:01.342
Everybody loved her.

181
00:09:01.343 --> 00:09:03.803
- No?
- Yeah.


182
00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:05.805
Yeah, no, I...
Uh, just, you know...


183
00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:08.183
Just it's been a day.

184
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:12.270
We gotta start lockin'
that door.


185
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:14.189
- What was that?
- Good morning.


186
00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:19.236
So when do I see
your next payment?


187
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.530
Weren't you just in here
with the same question?


188
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:25.074
Why the sudden rush?

189
00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:26.659
I think you misunderstand

190
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.578
the parameters
of this relationship.


191
00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:30.831
I need more money,
and I need it now.


192
00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:35.918
Hey, h-how 'bout instead
of us givin' you what we owe


193
00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:38.129
half a million at a time,

194
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.007
what if we $10 million
by the end of the week?


195
00:09:41.008 --> 00:09:42.508
You owe me 14.

196
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:43.760
I'm negotiating.

197
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.726
10 million.
One shot, and we're done.


198
00:09:51.518 --> 00:09:54.770
Okay, I'll play.
Say I'm interested. How?


199
00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:56.689
It's a yacht thing.

200
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.357
Well, I'm not givin' up

201
00:09:58.358 --> 00:09:59.650
on "It's a yacht thing."

202
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:02.069
You care to elaborate?

203
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.989
An underground poker game.
It's got a steep buy-in,


204
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.616
attracts
some of D. C.'s dirtiest.


205
00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:08.284
I'm talkin'
hedge fund managers, lobbyists,


206
00:10:08.285 --> 00:10:10.369
- politicians.
- This sounds like a robbery,


207
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.372
- not a con.
- It is.


208
00:10:13.373 --> 00:10:14.832
Something in between.

209
00:10:19.254 --> 00:10:21.213
What the hell?

210
00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:24.634
If you can pull it off,
we're square.


211
00:10:33.977 --> 00:10:36.520
Charlie, the Moonshot?

212
00:10:36.521 --> 00:10:37.897
Hold-hold on.

213
00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:40.191
Are we talkin'
about that yacht job


214
00:10:40.192 --> 00:10:42.485
that you two cased
a little while back?


215
00:10:42.486 --> 00:10:44.070
Yeah. It was the one
he canned


216
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:45.988
because we couldn't figure out
a way to get away clean.


217
00:10:45.989 --> 00:10:48.991
That and, uh, the whole
if they catch us


218
00:10:48.992 --> 00:10:51.202
they kill us
in international waters thing.


219
00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:53.329
We've got the plans.
We-we've got schematics.


220
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.039
I mean,
it's sitting right there.


221
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.083
Charlie, listen, I want
Daphne's overpriced boots


222
00:10:57.084 --> 00:10:59.001
off our necks
as badly as you do,


223
00:10:59.002 --> 00:11:02.296
but we agreed
that this was too dangerous.


224
00:11:02.297 --> 00:11:04.716
Not anymore.

225
00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:08.679
This.

226
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.151
<i>Hey, I just wanted
to say again how sorry I am</i>


227
00:11:24.152 --> 00:11:26.946
<i>for all of it.</i>

228
00:11:26.947 --> 00:11:29.657
<i>And I know
the timing is awkward,</i>


229
00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:32.076
<i>but my brother
is having a fundraiser,</i>


230
00:11:32.077 --> 00:11:35.162
<i>and I was kind of hoping
you'd be my plus one.</i>


231
00:11:35.163 --> 00:11:36.872
<i>Let me know.
And no pressure,</i>


232
00:11:36.873 --> 00:11:39.084
<i>but I'd really love to see you.</i>

233
00:11:42.921 --> 00:11:44.965
That how this works now?

234
00:11:46.842 --> 00:11:48.551
You call an audible
and expect us


235
00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:52.055
to just, what...
fall in line?


236
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.142
Saw an opportunity,
and I took it.


237
00:11:57.102 --> 00:11:58.302
Huh.

238
00:12:00.272 --> 00:12:02.149
What's goin' on, Charlie?

239
00:12:05.402 --> 00:12:07.987
You're a little bitten, huh?

240
00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:10.072
Come on.

241
00:12:10.073 --> 00:12:12.492
Come on, she's got you.
I get it.


242
00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:18.414
She doesn't know
about this side of me, Pop.


243
00:12:18.415 --> 00:12:20.625
What side of you?

244
00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:24.379
You are a stand-up guy.

245
00:12:25.964 --> 00:12:27.757
And stand-up guys
take care of their families.


246
00:12:27.758 --> 00:12:30.342
They do what needs to be done.

247
00:12:30.343 --> 00:12:32.511
I'm not sure
she's gonna see it that way.


248
00:12:32.512 --> 00:12:35.931
I mean, I-I don't even know
if I see it that way anymore.


249
00:12:35.932 --> 00:12:38.768
If this is gonna go anywhere,
me and her,


250
00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:41.395
how long I can get away
with lying to her


251
00:12:41.396 --> 00:12:42.689
has got a clock on it.

252
00:12:44.432 --> 00:12:48.268
I mean, Pop,
this-this may sound crazy,


253
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:52.266
but I never... I never really
wanted to go straight


254
00:12:52.267 --> 00:12:53.893
until her.

255
00:12:59.018 --> 00:13:01.404
And as long as Daphne
is in our lives...


256
00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:03.743
you can't.

257
00:13:04.703 --> 00:13:06.092
I hear you, son.

258
00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:12.025
Let me see these.

259
00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:21.218
If you're lucky enough
to find someone in your life


260
00:13:21.219 --> 00:13:23.846
that makes you feel
the way she does,


261
00:13:23.847 --> 00:13:25.682
you do not let them go.

262
00:13:26.474 --> 00:13:28.018
You go all in.

263
00:13:32.522 --> 00:13:34.899
We just gotta figure out how.

264
00:13:35.859 --> 00:13:37.819
And I think I got an idea.

265
00:13:41.807 --> 00:13:43.768
And the prodigal son
has returned.


266
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:46.812
You were right, Hill.

267
00:13:48.356 --> 00:13:49.981
Connor Maguire is stateside?

268
00:13:49.982 --> 00:13:51.799
Got a hit on one of his aliases

269
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.361
comin' through customs.

270
00:13:54.362 --> 00:13:55.820
He must be here meeting up

271
00:13:55.821 --> 00:13:58.807
with whoever's behind
Daphne's new revenue stream.


272
00:13:58.808 --> 00:14:00.560
- Mm.
- If we identify them...


273
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:04.418
we can figure out her next move.

274
00:14:08.876 --> 00:14:10.252
Peace offering.

275
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:13.881
Well, I prefer tequila.

276
00:14:16.258 --> 00:14:18.677
You know, if we wanna expand
this operation,


277
00:14:18.678 --> 00:14:20.428
we're gonna have
to work together.


278
00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:23.223
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

279
00:14:23.224 --> 00:14:24.557
You tryin' to prove
to the old man


280
00:14:24.558 --> 00:14:27.644
that you're good enough, eh?

281
00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:29.271
Since your ma clearly wasn't.

282
00:14:33.025 --> 00:14:35.860
You know, it's pathetic, really,

283
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:38.280
you seekin' out
the man who abandoned you.


284
00:14:39.532 --> 00:14:40.783
He came to me.

285
00:14:42.702 --> 00:14:44.787
He showed up
at my mother's funeral.


286
00:14:46.122 --> 00:14:48.081
I didn't plan
on working for him.


287
00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:49.999
But the more I got to know him
and the business,


288
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.418
the more I saw the potential

289
00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:53.254
of what this organization
could be.


290
00:14:55.047 --> 00:14:57.257
And what's that?

291
00:14:57.258 --> 00:14:58.675
We could do for our business

292
00:14:58.676 --> 00:15:00.635
what Bezos did
for selling books.


293
00:15:00.636 --> 00:15:03.138
Oh, yeah.
Oh, great. Right.


294
00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:04.899
So how do you plan
on doin' that, Ivy League?


295
00:15:06.183 --> 00:15:07.851
We unite
all the street-level operations


296
00:15:07.852 --> 00:15:11.354
by making them dependent on us
for distribution.


297
00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:13.398
We sell at a loss,

298
00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:14.733
undercut the competition.

299
00:15:14.734 --> 00:15:17.235
And once our rivals are weak,

300
00:15:17.236 --> 00:15:20.155
dependent on us instead of
the Mexican cartels...


301
00:15:20.156 --> 00:15:22.949
Instead of building
our own network here,


302
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.493
we steal theirs.

303
00:15:25.494 --> 00:15:27.872
Lost leader strategy.

304
00:15:32.293 --> 00:15:34.544
I'm not the enemy here, Connor.

305
00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:38.423
There's room for both of us
in this organization.


306
00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:42.428
With your managerial instincts
and my business acumen...


307
00:15:43.554 --> 00:15:45.764
We could make
a lot of money together.


308
00:15:50.352 --> 00:15:53.730
Now, you see...

309
00:15:53.731 --> 00:15:55.441
I like money.

310
00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:04.491
But there's just one thing
I need to know.


311
00:16:04.492 --> 00:16:07.869
If you're sellin' at a loss...

312
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.746
how do you make the money right?

313
00:16:09.747 --> 00:16:11.081
Hmm.

314
00:16:12.833 --> 00:16:15.669
Well, what can I say, Connor?

315
00:16:17.588 --> 00:16:19.215
I'm resourceful.

316
00:16:22.468 --> 00:16:24.761
Look, I shouldn't have gone
rogue back there with Daphne.


317
00:16:24.762 --> 00:16:26.638
But the pace we're moving,

318
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.223
sooner or later,
it's gonna bite us in the ass.


319
00:16:28.224 --> 00:16:30.600
And you think
one giant score is safer?


320
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:32.060
We walked away from the Moonshot

321
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.395
- for good reason.
- I think Pop and I figured out


322
00:16:34.396 --> 00:16:36.356
how to get us out alive.

323
00:16:36.357 --> 00:16:38.817
Uh, you're in on this now?

324
00:16:38.818 --> 00:16:40.694
Can someone please clue me in?

325
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.031
Robert Renway.

326
00:16:45.032 --> 00:16:46.950
Owns one of the biggest
private security firms


327
00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:48.660
this side of the Atlantic.

328
00:16:48.661 --> 00:16:50.161
Claims legitimacy,

329
00:16:50.162 --> 00:16:51.996
but he just hires mercs
for the highest bidder.


330
00:16:51.997 --> 00:16:53.206
Now, once a month,

331
00:16:53.207 --> 00:16:54.457
he's got
a high-stakes poker game


332
00:16:54.458 --> 00:16:56.209
on his private yacht.

333
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.919
It's his way of networking
with the major players


334
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.338
on both sides of the law.
The plan was to create


335
00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.674
some kind of diversion,
load the cash onto a boat,


336
00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:03.758
and disappear into the night.

337
00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:05.176
But we got hung up on logistics.

338
00:17:05.177 --> 00:17:07.512
Namely moving 400 pounds of cash

339
00:17:07.513 --> 00:17:09.514
off a boat
in the middle of the ocean


340
00:17:09.515 --> 00:17:10.974
without anybody noticing.

341
00:17:10.975 --> 00:17:12.934
But I think we solved that.

342
00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:15.311
Plus, you two
already have aliases


343
00:17:15.312 --> 00:17:17.981
and security clearances
to get on the boat as caterers.


344
00:17:17.982 --> 00:17:21.150
And Pop has already been vetted
as a dealer in the game.


345
00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:22.652
Thanks to an old friend,

346
00:17:22.653 --> 00:17:24.362
all Georgie has to do
is call in sick.


347
00:17:24.363 --> 00:17:26.114
Okay.

348
00:17:26.115 --> 00:17:28.658
We ran into trouble
getting into the money room.


349
00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:30.410
Do you guys have
a solve for that?


350
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:32.745
Oh! How about my seasickness?

351
00:17:32.746 --> 00:17:34.455
No. We're not doin'
the seasickness thing, Mom.


352
00:17:34.456 --> 00:17:36.040
- Why?
- Because it almost got us made


353
00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:37.333
on the Delaware job.
Stay focused.


354
00:17:37.334 --> 00:17:38.835
All-all we need is someone

355
00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.837
who actually has stakes
in the game.


356
00:17:40.838 --> 00:17:42.038
Who?

357
00:17:43.424 --> 00:17:45.258
<i>Ernesto Ricci.</i>

358
00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:48.261
<i>A gun runner who works
grey market arms deals.</i>


359
00:17:48.262 --> 00:17:50.972
<i>Now, the goal of the pre-game
is two-fold.</i>


360
00:17:50.973 --> 00:17:53.766
One, Ernesto catches
the eye of Renway


361
00:17:53.767 --> 00:17:55.518
and gets invited
to the private game.


362
00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:58.855
And two, we make
our million dollar buy-in


363
00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:00.481
to that game.

364
00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:02.568
And how do we do that?

365
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.031
With our Pastor Earle money?

366
00:18:08.032 --> 00:18:11.117
Guys, that's all the cash
we have left.


367
00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:13.786
Bird, it's gotta be done.

368
00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:15.705
One and-a two.

369
00:18:15.706 --> 00:18:17.707
And-a one, two, ready.

370
00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:19.335
Let's rock.

371
00:18:22.338 --> 00:18:24.172
Not barging in, am I?

372
00:18:28.177 --> 00:18:29.219
Yup.

373
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.388
<i>♪ I've had the blues ha ♪</i>

374
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.225
<i>♪ But here's the news ♪</i>

375
00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:36.768
There you go.

376
00:18:36.769 --> 00:18:39.145
Could build a house on that.
Load-bearing.


377
00:18:39.146 --> 00:18:41.105
- That's a high denomination.
- These tiny little ones?


378
00:18:41.106 --> 00:18:43.274
- High denomination.
- Really?


379
00:18:43.275 --> 00:18:45.193
<i>Renway's lookin'
for money and connections.</i>


380
00:18:45.194 --> 00:18:47.946
People he can see doin'
business with in the future.


381
00:18:47.947 --> 00:18:49.322
So you gotta win
with enough flare


382
00:18:49.323 --> 00:18:51.032
that he notices.

383
00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:52.617
<i>That's how you get

384
00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:54.244
<i>♪ Out on my own,
I need to relax ♪</i>


385
00:18:54.245 --> 00:18:56.037
You flirting with me?

386
00:18:56.038 --> 00:18:58.998
Oh, looks like Magnum's got
a winner.


387
00:18:58.999 --> 00:19:00.583
What do you think,
he's got enough to beat us?


388
00:19:00.584 --> 00:19:02.252
- I fold.
- Not you.


389
00:19:02.253 --> 00:19:03.795
Not him.

390
00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:05.923
Quit stallin'.
You in or out?


391
00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:09.551
Oh, I'm all in.

392
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:15.265
And when he takes
a shine to me...


393
00:19:15.266 --> 00:19:17.725
<i>And that's where I step in
with Ernesto's bona fides.</i>


394
00:19:17.726 --> 00:19:20.061
<i>I will make sure

00:19:20.062 --> 00:19:22.064
<i>your alias on the dark web

396
00:19:22.982 --> 00:19:24.742
All right, gentlemen,
please show your cards.


397
00:19:28.237 --> 00:19:30.947
I'm sorry, I didn't know
if this one was good.


398
00:19:30.948 --> 00:19:33.992
Well, it's all right now.

399
00:19:33.993 --> 00:19:35.201
I appreciate you.

400
00:19:35.202 --> 00:19:36.995
You'll pack this up for me?
Thank you.


401
00:19:36.996 --> 00:19:38.706
<i>♪ I've been thinkin'

402
00:19:42.793 --> 00:19:44.044
Cash out?

403
00:19:44.503 --> 00:19:45.795
I think you played him

404
00:19:45.796 --> 00:19:47.569
more than the game itself,
my man.


405
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.257
Robert Renway.

406
00:19:49.258 --> 00:19:51.092
Oh, I know.

407
00:19:51.093 --> 00:19:53.011
- We run in the same circles.
- Yeah, so I hear.


408
00:19:53.012 --> 00:19:55.930
- Mm-hmm.
- How long you in town?


409
00:19:55.931 --> 00:19:58.224
Few days.
Maybe less if I don't find


410
00:19:58.225 --> 00:20:00.143
more action
than these low-rent games.


411
00:20:00.144 --> 00:20:02.770
<i>I'm lookin' for some
higher stakes, you know?</i>


412
00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:04.273
Don't push him too hard, Charlie.

413
00:20:05.316 --> 00:20:06.900
Yeah, I hear you.

414
00:20:08.027 --> 00:20:09.227
Nice to meet you, bro.

415
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.655
Nice to meet you.

416
00:20:13.615 --> 00:20:15.074
<i>Well, look at the bright side.</i>

417
00:20:15.075 --> 00:20:16.869
<i>Least you walk away
with a million bucks.</i>


418
00:20:24.043 --> 00:20:25.293
Hope to see you there.

419
00:20:37.139 --> 00:20:38.766
Hi.

420
00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:42.686
My dad'll be easy.

421
00:20:42.687 --> 00:20:45.006
It's, uh, my mom
you'll have to watch out for.


422
00:20:45.007 --> 00:20:48.650
She's an iron fist
in a velvet glove.


423
00:20:48.651 --> 00:20:50.153
No different than a polygraph.

424
00:20:51.387 --> 00:20:52.988
Touché.

425
00:20:52.989 --> 00:20:54.189
Emma?

426
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.093
Here we go.

427
00:20:58.094 --> 00:21:00.496
Charlie, I want you
to meet my parents,


428
00:21:00.497 --> 00:21:03.540
- Grace and Joe Hill.
- Hi. Charlie Nicoletti.


429
00:21:03.541 --> 00:21:05.167
Nice to finally meet you.

430
00:21:05.168 --> 00:21:06.710
Wonderful home you have here.

431
00:21:07.143 --> 00:21:09.145
Bricks stuck together
by hard work.


432
00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:12.758
So, Charlie, what do you do?

433
00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:15.335
Own a bar with my family
in Baltimore.


434
00:21:17.847 --> 00:21:19.390
Dad's always saying
small business


435
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:20.975
is the backbone of our country.

436
00:21:23.056 --> 00:21:24.561
Let's get a drink, Charlie.

437
00:21:24.562 --> 00:21:26.438
I have so many questions
for the man


438
00:21:26.439 --> 00:21:28.023
that my daughter
has been hiding.


439
00:21:28.024 --> 00:21:29.691
Mom, if he's not back
in five minutes,


440
00:21:29.692 --> 00:21:30.892
I'm sending help.

441
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.362
She's trying.

442
00:21:33.363 --> 00:21:35.280
Don't be so hard on your mother.

443
00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:37.866
I know. It's just, um...

444
00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:39.869
this one's different, you know?

445
00:21:42.914 --> 00:21:44.499
Who's that?

446
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.170
Shark in the water.

447
00:21:52.298 --> 00:21:53.757
Here's to you.

448
00:21:53.758 --> 00:21:55.509
Make sure you're focused
on the...


449
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.012
- Excuse me.
- Nice to meet you.


450
00:21:59.639 --> 00:22:01.391
Claire Fox is here,
and she wants a word.


451
00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:05.602
Do you know about what?

452
00:22:05.603 --> 00:22:07.020
Nothing's for free, David,

453
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:08.690
especially Claire Fox's support.

454
00:22:10.817 --> 00:22:13.610
Senator Hill.
It's been too long.


455
00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:16.238
But I must say,
the whole "Lion in Winter" vibe


456
00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:17.865
really suits you.

457
00:22:17.866 --> 00:22:19.700
Still lobbying
for the evil empire?


458
00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:22.453
Oh, please. Guns and tobacco
are so early aughts.


459
00:22:22.454 --> 00:22:25.581
You know me, I have my hand
in a lot of pots.


460
00:22:25.582 --> 00:22:27.207
What brings you here?

461
00:22:27.208 --> 00:22:28.834
Well, I wanted to get
some face time


462
00:22:28.835 --> 00:22:30.335
with the soon-to-be
junior senator


463
00:22:30.336 --> 00:22:31.920
from Washington state.

464
00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:33.256
You must be so proud.

465
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:36.050
Couldn't be prouder.

466
00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:43.558
- Another one?
- Please. Thank you.


467
00:22:44.225 --> 00:22:45.643
Ernesto?

468
00:22:47.228 --> 00:22:48.896
Wow.

469
00:22:48.897 --> 00:22:50.397
Now, I just did not peg you
for the kind of guy


470
00:22:50.398 --> 00:22:52.691
that'd be rubbin' elbows
with these K Street yuppies.


471
00:22:52.692 --> 00:22:54.234
I almost didn't recognize you.

472
00:22:54.235 --> 00:22:55.736
Barely recognize myself

473
00:22:55.737 --> 00:22:57.237
in these rags, you know?

474
00:22:57.238 --> 00:22:59.114
But you gotta put
the square suit on


475
00:22:59.115 --> 00:23:01.325
to do business
with these political types.


476
00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:02.659
Quietly, of course.
You understand, right?


477
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.370
Oh, I got ya.

478
00:23:05.371 --> 00:23:06.705
It's always helpful to know

479
00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:07.873
the next generation
of decision-makers.


480
00:23:07.874 --> 00:23:09.458
- You know what I mean?
- It is.


481
00:23:09.459 --> 00:23:10.667
- Hey.
- Hey.


482
00:23:10.668 --> 00:23:13.921
- Robert Renway.
- Emma Hill.


483
00:23:13.922 --> 00:23:15.255
How do you two know each other?

484
00:23:15.256 --> 00:23:17.799
Uh, we don't. We just met.

485
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.635
Talking about how impressed
we are with David


486
00:23:19.636 --> 00:23:21.887
- and, uh, the drinks.
- Hmm.


487
00:23:21.888 --> 00:23:25.140
Charlie seems nice,
don't you think?


488
00:23:25.141 --> 00:23:27.601
Emma's practically glowing.

489
00:23:27.602 --> 00:23:31.522
- You like him?
- What's not to like?


490
00:23:31.523 --> 00:23:33.232
He's handsome, smart,

491
00:23:33.233 --> 00:23:34.775
holds his own in this crowd.

492
00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:37.819
Bit too smooth for my taste.

493
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.656
Oh, please. When we met,
you had no shortage


494
00:23:40.657 --> 00:23:42.659
of ambition or charisma either.

495
00:23:44.077 --> 00:23:46.538
You two are more similar
than you think.


496
00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.625
Oh, there he is.
Man of the hour.


497
00:23:51.626 --> 00:23:53.919
Miss Fox. We finally meet.

498
00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.879
It's a great turnout tonight.

499
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.047
It's amazing
what aligning yourself


500
00:23:57.048 --> 00:23:58.465
with the right people
can accomplish.


501
00:23:58.466 --> 00:23:59.926
Indeed.

502
00:24:00.718 --> 00:24:02.720
Which brings me to why I'm here.

503
00:24:04.973 --> 00:24:07.140
I wanted to introduce you
to Jennifer West.


504
00:24:07.141 --> 00:24:09.643
She's bright, insightful,

505
00:24:09.644 --> 00:24:12.188
and I think she'd make a great
addition to your campaign.


506
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.857
Oh.

507
00:24:15.858 --> 00:24:17.735
Really, that's fantastic.

508
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.743
Ah, Charlie.

509
00:24:26.744 --> 00:24:29.788
My wife's been singing
your praises.


510
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:32.374
I'm flattered. I mean,
she obviously has great taste.


511
00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:35.003
You're good at that, aren't you?

512
00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:38.631
Always knowing just what to say.

513
00:24:41.926 --> 00:24:43.093
Part of the job.

514
00:24:43.094 --> 00:24:45.304
You know,
just holding conversations.


515
00:24:45.305 --> 00:24:46.930
Right...

516
00:24:46.931 --> 00:24:48.433
as a bartender.

517
00:24:50.977 --> 00:24:52.603
You don't like me very much.

518
00:24:52.604 --> 00:24:54.771
Well, call it
a professional liability,


519
00:24:54.772 --> 00:24:57.566
but I'm wary of anyone

520
00:24:57.567 --> 00:24:59.443
who always has
all the right answers.


521
00:24:59.444 --> 00:25:02.821
Hmm. Well, bartender, politician,

522
00:25:02.822 --> 00:25:05.617
we're all just giving people
what they want, right?


523
00:25:07.201 --> 00:25:09.411
You think we're the same?

524
00:25:09.412 --> 00:25:11.413
I came to this country
with nothing,


525
00:25:11.414 --> 00:25:13.332
worked hard to get where I am.

526
00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:15.918
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't want more for her.


527
00:25:17.879 --> 00:25:19.212
So what's your angle here,
Charlie?


528
00:25:19.213 --> 00:25:20.673
Dad.

529
00:25:21.883 --> 00:25:23.926
- It's fine. No, it's fine.
- No, it's not.


530
00:25:25.678 --> 00:25:27.304
Don't you dare judge Charlie.

531
00:25:27.305 --> 00:25:30.182
He has more integrity
than every person here tonight,


532
00:25:30.183 --> 00:25:32.809
- apparently including you.
- It's fine. It's fine.


533
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.228
It's fine.

534
00:25:37.565 --> 00:25:39.609
Come on. Let's go.

535
00:25:41.861 --> 00:25:43.763
Grace, it was lovely
to meet you.


536
00:25:43.764 --> 00:25:45.258
I look forward to the memoir.

537
00:25:49.827 --> 00:25:52.167
Stop it.
I can feel your look.


538
00:25:52.168 --> 00:25:53.420
Good.

539
00:25:58.127 --> 00:25:59.545
Hey.

540
00:26:01.714 --> 00:26:05.926
- Thank you for having my back.
- Of course.


541
00:26:05.927 --> 00:26:07.260
I don't know who that was, but...

542
00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:09.389
It's-it's fine.
It's all good.


543
00:26:11.557 --> 00:26:13.141
Go back inside.
I know you've got


544
00:26:13.142 --> 00:26:15.936
people to talk to.
I'll, uh, I'll call you later.


545
00:26:15.937 --> 00:26:17.145
- Okay?
- Okay.


546
00:26:17.146 --> 00:26:18.346
Thank you.

547
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.347
See you tomorrow night.

548
00:26:48.533 --> 00:26:50.271
Hi.

549
00:26:50.272 --> 00:26:52.232
Thank you, Mr. Ricci.
Good luck.


550
00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:54.536
- Ernesto.
- Ah.


551
00:26:54.537 --> 00:26:55.985
Not slummin' it anymore, are we?

552
00:26:55.986 --> 00:26:57.778
Yeah. No more trash bags.

553
00:26:57.779 --> 00:26:59.363
Just streamlined
and razor-sharp tonight.


554
00:26:59.364 --> 00:27:01.490
I like it.
Well, hey, the game's inside.


555
00:27:01.491 --> 00:27:03.367
Make yourself at home.
What's mine is yours.


556
00:27:03.368 --> 00:27:05.202
I'll remember that.

557
00:27:05.203 --> 00:27:06.403
Okay.

558
00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:09.081
Security's gonna be tight.

559
00:27:09.082 --> 00:27:11.917
Remember, these are
Renway's guys. Former mercs.


560
00:27:11.918 --> 00:27:13.253
<i>They're not to be messed with.</i>

561
00:27:14.756 --> 00:27:16.547
<i>Now, he's got a guard
in the money room,</i>


562
00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:19.592
<i>but he also has cameras
feeding into a hard drive</i>


563
00:27:19.593 --> 00:27:22.386
<i>just in case that guard
decides he wants to skim.</i>


564
00:27:22.387 --> 00:27:24.555
Now, those cameras
aren't monitored live, though.


565
00:27:24.556 --> 00:27:25.931
Now, there's
no personal belongings


566
00:27:25.932 --> 00:27:27.391
allowed in the card room,

567
00:27:27.392 --> 00:27:28.310
<i>but that's
how we're gonna sneak in</i>


568
00:27:28.311 --> 00:27:30.311
- <i>our Trojan horse.</i>
- Ernesto.


569
00:27:30.312 --> 00:27:31.729
Ah.
<i>And while guard is trying</i>


570
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.023
<i>to figure out how to turn
my phone off...</i>


571
00:27:34.024 --> 00:27:35.566
<i>That's when the phones
will be close enough</i>


572
00:27:35.567 --> 00:27:38.611
<i>for me to hack into his phone
and clone it.</i>


573
00:27:38.612 --> 00:27:41.197
Gentlemen and lady.

574
00:27:41.198 --> 00:27:43.574
You know the rules.
Who's feelin' lucky?

Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

584
00:27:58.465 --> 00:28:00.508
Oh, you know, I never heard
that one before?


585
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:02.551
Gotta get you some new lines, papi.

586
00:28:02.552 --> 00:28:03.886

587

592
00:28:16.608 --> 00:28:18.359
Whoo. Hell of a river.

593
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.070
Hell of a river.

594
00:28:21.947 --> 00:28:23.147
Call.

595
00:28:24.407 --> 00:28:25.992
Gentlemen, cards.

596
00:28:27.035 --> 00:28:28.370
Bam.

597
00:28:34.084 --> 00:28:36.669
Lady luck can be
a vicious mistress, my friend.


598
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.172
Oh, Go buy a lotto ticket
on your way home, bro.


599
00:28:40.173 --> 00:28:43.092
Je-sus.
This guy is too much.


600
00:28:43.093 --> 00:28:45.594
All right, we playin' cards?
You gonna deal or what?


601
00:28:45.595 --> 00:28:47.596
<i>Bird, once you have
what you need,</i>


602
00:28:47.597 --> 00:28:49.431
<i>Mom'll bring us drinks

603
00:28:49.432 --> 00:28:50.632
<i>it's showtime.</i>

604
00:28:52.102 --> 00:28:53.645
Here is your Scotch, sir.

605
00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:57.690
And another water
for the dealer.


606
00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:59.024
Thanks, Fran.

607
00:29:01.862 --> 00:29:04.488
The name's Julie,
but you are very welcome.


608
00:29:04.489 --> 00:29:05.906
Hey, you guys gonna flirt

609
00:29:05.907 --> 00:29:07.408
or you gonna deal the cards, huh?

610
00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:08.609
Come on. What?

611
00:29:12.873 --> 00:29:14.582
Hey, you know, these cards
are gonna land


612
00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:16.458
somewhere very uncomfortable
for you, my friend,


613
00:29:16.459 --> 00:29:18.294
those ones
don't start shapin' up.


614
00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:19.628
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy.


615
00:29:19.629 --> 00:29:20.505
This is me takin' it easy.

616
00:29:20.506 --> 00:29:22.465
Sir, please.

617
00:29:40.692 --> 00:29:42.277
Yeah, okay.

618
00:29:42.861 --> 00:29:44.070
Call.

619
00:29:46.323 --> 00:29:47.866
Gentlemen, cards.

620
00:29:52.704 --> 00:29:54.663
Ooh.
That's a winner.


621
00:29:54.664 --> 00:29:56.624
Oh, you think
this is funny, huh?


622
00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:58.292
Bozo the clown?

623
00:29:58.293 --> 00:30:00.210
What are you doin'?
You, you smilin'.


624
00:30:00.211 --> 00:30:01.253
You gonna be swimmin'
off a this boat


625
00:30:01.254 --> 00:30:03.213
if you don't wipe the smile
off your face,


626
00:30:03.214 --> 00:30:05.215
- you understand? Huh?
- Ernesto, let's take a walk.


627
00:30:05.216 --> 00:30:07.009
No, no, I don't want to walk.
I don't want to walk.


628
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.260
I wanna play,
only this game is fixed.


629
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:09.386
Hey, there's nothing fixed here.

630
00:30:09.387 --> 00:30:10.429
Tonight's just not your night, man.

631
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.098
That's it.
Come on. Please. Please.


632
00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:14.684
Let's go talk.

633
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.852
Hey, you know what?
Don't to... you don't touch me.


634
00:30:16.853 --> 00:30:18.354
- Calm down.
- You don't need to do that.


635
00:30:18.355 --> 00:30:19.438
Why don't you take a breather
for a minute?


636
00:30:19.439 --> 00:30:21.231
Nah, I'm cool. I'm cool.
Hey, I'm cool.


637
00:30:21.232 --> 00:30:23.776
- Okay.
- I'm cool. Yeah.


638
00:30:23.777 --> 00:30:25.611
Look, why don't you, uh,
just take a beat?


639
00:30:25.612 --> 00:30:27.154
It's all good.

640
00:30:27.155 --> 00:30:28.447
- Game's not goin' anywhere.
- Yeah.


641
00:30:28.448 --> 00:30:30.324
Yeah, no, no.
I'll take a break.


642
00:30:30.325 --> 00:30:31.952
This is me breakin'. Mm-hmm.

643
00:30:58.701 --> 00:31:00.270
Damn it, come on.

644
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.963
- Wow.
- Let's get this done.


645
00:31:31.553 --> 00:31:33.558
- And she is?
- Driver.


646
00:31:37.017 --> 00:31:38.767
So you're not in labor?

647
00:31:38.768 --> 00:31:41.603
So who texted me?

648
00:31:41.604 --> 00:31:42.938
All-all right, uh...

649
00:31:42.939 --> 00:31:44.983
Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.

650
00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:49.653
Time's up.

651
00:31:49.654 --> 00:31:51.530
Two minutes.

652
00:31:51.531 --> 00:31:52.740
Charlie, we gotta go.

653
00:31:52.741 --> 00:31:55.492
You wanna get
out of this or not?


654
00:31:55.493 --> 00:31:57.745
You guys keep loading.
I'll buy us some time.


655
00:31:57.746 --> 00:31:59.039
Go, go, go, go, go.

656
00:32:01.416 --> 00:32:03.167
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.


657
00:32:03.168 --> 00:32:04.835
- Excuse me.
- Can you help me just...


658
00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:06.378
Oh, no. Oh. Oh, no.

659
00:32:06.379 --> 00:32:08.589
I'm sorry, can't you help me
get this...


660
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.759
Oh, how rude!

661
00:32:22.812 --> 00:32:24.272
We got a problem.

662
00:32:41.506 --> 00:32:43.274
Let's get you set back up.

663
00:32:43.275 --> 00:32:45.110
Appreciate that.
Thank you so much.


664
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:48.363
Hey, apologies for before, huh?

665
00:32:48.364 --> 00:32:50.783
- No hard feelings.
- None at all, my friend.


666
00:32:52.118 --> 00:32:53.828
Sir. A word?

667
00:32:56.038 --> 00:32:58.123
What'd I miss?

668
00:32:58.124 --> 00:33:00.125
The money is gone.

669
00:33:00.126 --> 00:33:02.385
What do you mean, money is gone?

670
00:33:02.386 --> 00:33:03.846
It can't be.

671
00:33:04.964 --> 00:33:06.214
Hey, is it me or does it feel

672
00:33:06.215 --> 00:33:08.426
like somethin' just hit the fan?

673
00:33:15.641 --> 00:33:17.767
Go, go, go!

674
00:33:17.768 --> 00:33:19.437
Get downstairs. Hurry!

675
00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:23.482
Don't let them get away!

676
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:27.193
Everyone remain calm.
There's a situation.


677
00:33:27.194 --> 00:33:29.279
We have it under control.
We will get


678
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.780
- all your money back, I promise.
- What?


679
00:33:30.781 --> 00:33:32.449
What do you mean
get our money back?


680
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.826
What happened to our money?

681
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.830
Freeze!

682
00:33:38.831 --> 00:33:40.790
Let me see your hands.

683
00:33:40.791 --> 00:33:42.417
Hands up!

684
00:33:47.882 --> 00:33:50.509
Seamus. Sit.

685
00:33:53.095 --> 00:33:55.055
I just wanted to have a chat,
you know?


686
00:33:55.056 --> 00:33:57.058
Just me and you.
Just the boys, you know?


687
00:34:00.227 --> 00:34:02.687
See, I know that Daphne's

688
00:34:02.688 --> 00:34:05.482
been supplementin' her drug
losses with an outside source.


689
00:34:05.483 --> 00:34:08.276
So... who is it?

690
00:34:08.277 --> 00:34:09.569
I don't know.

691
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:10.905
Uhh...

692
00:34:12.114 --> 00:34:13.865
Try again.

693
00:34:13.866 --> 00:34:15.826
The money's comin' from where?

694
00:34:21.665 --> 00:34:22.916
Impossible, huh?

695
00:34:22.917 --> 00:34:24.667
I said nearly.

696
00:34:24.668 --> 00:34:26.253
Moonshot indeed.

697
00:34:27.755 --> 00:34:31.258
Hey. Our cut
to pay back the buy-in.


698
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.261
Meet Daphne,
and then we're done.


699
00:34:42.061 --> 00:34:44.646
- Hey.
- Yeah.


700
00:34:44.647 --> 00:34:47.691
We gonna talk about
what happened tonight?


701
00:34:48.442 --> 00:34:50.361
You broke cover.

702
00:34:51.529 --> 00:34:53.863
Oh, I just got...

703
00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:55.991
caught up in the moment.
That's all.


704
00:34:57.618 --> 00:34:59.702
We can't pretend
this isn't happening, babe.


705
00:34:59.703 --> 00:35:01.539
We can't just will it away.

706
00:35:03.374 --> 00:35:05.626
- I know that.
- Do you?


707
00:35:06.794 --> 00:35:08.545
I'm good. Okay?

708
00:35:08.546 --> 00:35:11.965
Hey, we just walked off
with $10 million, Frannie.


709
00:35:11.966 --> 00:35:14.218
Come on.
Can't be slippin' that much.


710
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.272
Hey. Thanks for calling.

711
00:35:27.273 --> 00:35:29.232
Connor's in the air
in two hours.


712
00:35:29.233 --> 00:35:31.484
Got a report
that his jet is being fueled


713
00:35:31.485 --> 00:35:34.779
for an international flight,
so the FBI's standing down.


714
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.158
Oh, no, you boys didn't get
to play cops and robbers?


715
00:35:40.244 --> 00:35:42.871
But, seriously,
why come all the way to D. C.


716
00:35:42.872 --> 00:35:45.039
Only to turn right back around?

717
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.167
There has to be more to it.

718
00:35:47.168 --> 00:35:49.288
Which is why I figured
we'd follow him to the airport.


719
00:35:50.546 --> 00:35:52.380
You're the best, Vik.

720
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:53.799
Don't make me blush.

721
00:36:06.937 --> 00:36:08.647
The hell is this?

722
00:36:15.738 --> 00:36:17.156
Damn it.

723
00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:25.915
Out. Now.

724
00:36:34.173 --> 00:36:36.454
And you can take the mask off.
I already know who you are.


725
00:36:42.056 --> 00:36:43.973
There he is.

726
00:36:43.974 --> 00:36:47.018
Ah, well,
you know, when I found out


727
00:36:47.019 --> 00:36:49.938
that Daphne was workin'
with the man who ripped me off,


728
00:36:49.939 --> 00:36:52.065
kick in the balls
that felt like, you know?


729
00:36:52.066 --> 00:36:53.983
Oh, no. But it kept
your pockets fat, didn't it?


730
00:36:53.984 --> 00:36:55.277
Oh, yeah.

731
00:36:56.987 --> 00:36:58.781
Very well now, yeah.

732
00:37:07.998 --> 00:37:10.500
That covers the deal
Daphne and I had.


733
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:12.377
You and me, we're done.

734
00:37:12.378 --> 00:37:13.712
Oh, yeah.

735
00:37:16.882 --> 00:37:18.968
Never truer words spoken, son.

736
00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:28.851
There it is.

737
00:37:28.852 --> 00:37:30.437
That's Daphne's
secret revenue stream.


738
00:37:33.348 --> 00:37:35.591
- What are you doing?
- My job.


739
00:37:35.592 --> 00:37:37.671
This is enough
to put Connor away.


740
00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:39.591
Arresting Connor
is a short-term win.


741
00:37:39.592 --> 00:37:40.885
Think bigger picture.

742
00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.823
You know, I wonder
what your father's gonna say,


743
00:37:50.824 --> 00:37:52.992
you steppin' in
on your sister's business.


744
00:37:52.993 --> 00:37:54.368
I mean, I'm guessing
you're gonna keep


745
00:37:54.369 --> 00:37:56.579
all this for yourself, right?

746
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.372
I mean,
it's just kind of obvious


747
00:37:58.373 --> 00:38:00.291
he never really trusted you
to run things,


748
00:38:00.292 --> 00:38:02.302
so he brings his daughter in,

749
00:38:02.303 --> 00:38:04.481
has her step up
where you couldn't, right?


750
00:38:05.547 --> 00:38:08.424
Does your mouth
ever stop movin', son?


751
00:38:08.425 --> 00:38:11.010
Let me ask you, Connor,
you know that saying,


752
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:13.347
"Every king has an heir
and a spare"?


753
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:17.017
Which one am I lookin' at?

754
00:38:26.026 --> 00:38:28.195
Looks like we got a tail.

755
00:38:35.452 --> 00:38:37.913
Well, until next time, eh?

756
00:38:39.373 --> 00:38:40.573
Yeah.

757
00:38:43.377 --> 00:38:44.795
Damn it!

758
00:38:53.971 --> 00:38:55.510
Okay, here they come.

759
00:39:07.726 --> 00:39:09.818
Workin' with a man
who ripped us off?


760
00:39:10.246 --> 00:39:12.326
<i>Is that what they taught you
in business school, huh?</i>


761
00:39:13.833 --> 00:39:17.087
You know, I'm not sure
how Daddy's gonna feel


762
00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.521
about how you've been runnin'
things with him away.


763
00:39:19.522 --> 00:39:22.181
Connor, I thought we had
an understanding.


764
00:39:22.182 --> 00:39:24.059
Well, then you're a fool.

765
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.811
But thanks for the 10 mill.

766
00:39:25.812 --> 00:39:27.938
You're not just screwing
me over here.


767
00:39:27.939 --> 00:39:29.523
This is our family's business.

768
00:39:29.524 --> 00:39:30.983
<i>You're not part of this family.</i>

769
00:39:30.984 --> 00:39:32.484
<i>You never have been.</i>

770
00:39:32.485 --> 00:39:34.319
And, now, the only friend
that you have left


771
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.447
is just some two-bit shyster.

772
00:39:37.448 --> 00:39:39.157
<i>And I'm sure
he's gonna find a way</i>


773
00:39:39.158 --> 00:39:40.951
<i>to make another 10 mill.</i>

774
00:39:40.952 --> 00:39:43.578
So in the meantime...

775
00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:45.623
you want what's mine, sister?

776
00:39:48.042 --> 00:39:49.627
Come and get it.

777
00:39:55.967 --> 00:39:58.051
And he just took it.

778
00:39:58.052 --> 00:40:00.137
I'm lucky he didn't kill me.

779
00:40:00.138 --> 00:40:03.015
But, I mean, that's...

780
00:40:03.016 --> 00:40:04.182
not the end of it.

781
00:40:04.183 --> 00:40:06.601
I might...

782
00:40:06.602 --> 00:40:08.104
I mighta gotten made.

783
00:40:11.649 --> 00:40:14.026
- By who?
- Feds.


784
00:40:14.027 --> 00:40:16.111
Oh, Jesus.

785
00:40:16.112 --> 00:40:18.113
Uh, I think
they were followin' Connor.


786
00:40:18.114 --> 00:40:19.574
They saw your face?

787
00:40:20.825 --> 00:40:23.735
No. No, I had the mask down.

788
00:40:23.736 --> 00:40:26.115
So how would they make you?

789
00:40:26.116 --> 00:40:28.498
Just a feeling.

790
00:40:28.499 --> 00:40:30.882
You know, just a bad feeling.

791
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.045
You're probably
just being paranoid.


792
00:40:35.046 --> 00:40:36.673
- Hey, come on, guys.
- Yeah.


793
00:40:36.674 --> 00:40:39.843
We did it.
It was a clean score.


794
00:40:39.844 --> 00:40:42.453
We're all in one piece.
We should feel good about this.


795
00:40:42.454 --> 00:40:43.847
Let's not panic

796
00:40:43.848 --> 00:40:46.099
until we have
a reason to panic, all right?


797
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.989
- All right?
- Yeah. Thanks, Pop.


798
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.685
Everything good?

799
00:41:30.478 --> 00:41:33.856
Well, you know that case
I was telling you about?


800
00:41:38.986 --> 00:41:41.739
I think I finally caught a lead.

801
00:41:43.658 --> 00:41:45.118
Well, that's great.

802
00:41:46.202 --> 00:41:47.402
Mm-hmm.

803
00:41:57.547 --> 00:41:59.214
You okay?

804
00:41:59.215 --> 00:42:02.843
I know this week
was a lot, but...


805
00:42:02.844 --> 00:42:04.178
I think this is worth it.
