<i>Previously on</i>
"The Company You Keep"...

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,757
- Simon?
- Yeah, he started calling

3
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:04,882
last week.
I don't know why.

4
00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:06,548
I don't need to know why.
You can decline.

5
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:09,174
Claire Fox? Her support
is not the kind you want.

6
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,798
It's amazing
what aligning yourself

7
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:11,758
with the right people
can accomplish.

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,132
Always comes at a cost.

9
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,340
I wanted to introduce you
to Jennifer West.

10
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:17,382
I think she'd make a great
addition to your campaign.

11
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:18,590
Connor Maguire is stateside?

12
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:19,715
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:21,798
The feds are
already watching us.

14
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,923
Your father trusts me
to handle things.

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,548
You know when I found out
that Daphne was working with

16
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:26,882
the man who ripped me off...

17
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,757
kick in the balls
that felt like, you know?

18
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,590
That's Daphne's secret
revenue stream.

19
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:32,341
That covers the deal
Daphne and I had.

20
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,049
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,048
I finally figured it out.

22
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:55,466
Figured what out?

23
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,257
17 across. Riposte.

24
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,300
Huh.

25
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,631
Guessing the fencing lessons
I took as a kid paid off.

26
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:06,466
Thank you.
Do not tell my mom.

27
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,340
Nice.

28
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:11,174
- What else you got?
- Uh...

29
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:12,757
mm.

30
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:16,257
Five down,

31
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:19,215
Seven letters.

32
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,215
- Hey.
- Huh?

33
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,424
- You good?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:27,216
I'm just thinking about
your, uh, crossword.

35
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,548
You know you can tell me
if something's going on.

36
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,548
Hey...

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,715
what if we skip work today?

38
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,757
Crawl back into bed,
cue up a film,

39
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,258
pretend the world doesn't exist.

40
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:47,007
Hmm.

41
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,090
Hello, world.

42
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,632
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,965
Hey.

44
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,923
I knew we'd get something
on the security cams.

45
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:59,382
Can you make out
our mystery man?

46
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:01,757
Partial plate?
I'll take it.

47
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:03,757
No, that's great, Mason.

48
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,924
Yeah, okay I'll see you soon.

49
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,175
You got to go.

50
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,465
As much as I want to stay.

51
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:20,966
Um, I got a bunch of stuff
to do here anyway, so...

52
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,174
Hey, look, I'm around later
if you want to talk.

53
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,215
Okay, great.

54
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,008
- Okay. Have a good day.
- You too.

55
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:37,215
- Hey, uh, "Charade."
- Huh?

56
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:39,299
Five down.

57
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,007
"Charade." It's one of
my parents' favorite movies.

58
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:45,840
When this thing wraps up,
maybe we can stay in,

59
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,174
watch a little "Charade,"
see where the day takes us.

60
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:50,548
Yeah, I'd like that.

61
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,840
- Me too.
- I'll see you.

62
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,300
Bye.

63
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,798
What happened to your
associate was regretful,

64
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,340
but I assure you,
Connor Maguire will have...

65
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,590
Don't you mean your brother?

66
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,590
Connor Maguire
will have no impact

67
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,216
on our partnership
moving forward.

68
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:27,257
I understand we don't get
to choose our family,

69
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:29,757
but it's not just your brother
that concerns me.

70
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,590
Since we began selling
your product,

71
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:32,965
the feds have been all over us.

72
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:36,174
Your partnership comes with
too much heat.

73
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,007
What if I could
turn down the heat?

74
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,715
Say I find a way to get
our product out of

75
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:42,673
those shipping containers
and back on the streets.

76
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:44,923
You do that, I think we can find

77
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,381
some way to work
out our differences.

78
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:48,923
Still we're talking
Coast Guard, port authority,

79
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:54,423
customs... so, unless you have
friends in high places...

80
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:56,631
As a matter of fact, I do.

81
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:59,590
- There she is.
- Hey, babe.

82
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:02,673
- Oh, that dress is stunning.
- Thank you.

83
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:04,715
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

84
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:07,174
Stop. I've been wanting
to catch up.

85
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:08,757
I hear you've been
spending time in Europe.

86
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:11,423
- Ooh, la, la.
- I've been consulting

87
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,506
for this big transnational organization,

88
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,631
but I must say
the experience has been

89
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,590
tragically lacking in fine wine
and Italian villas.

90
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,257
Couldn't be worse
than the swamp.

91
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:23,798
Well, let's just say it is
no toga party at Sigma Chi.

92
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,215
Right?

93
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:28,090
Well, nothing is.

94
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,381
- Excuse me.
- Yup.

95
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,923
- Mimosas?
- Please.

96
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:34,758
- Let's make them bottomless.
- All right.

97
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,049
I'm never gonna let you
live that down.

98
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,798
- Okay, can I be real?
- When are you not?

99
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,132
Fair.

100
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,631
The red tape in this town
is killing me.

101
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:47,757
- Don't get me started.
- Here you go.

102
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:49,381
Thank you.

103
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:53,049
If anyone could help me
grease the wheels in Washington

104
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,673
it is the best damn social
chair Kappa Theta ever had.

105
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:59,757
- I really was.
- I still can't believe

106
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,506
you're chief of staff
to the House Majority Whip.

107
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,590
I thought you'd be working for
the president by now.

108
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:08,882
Trust me, I'm on it.

109
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,465
I bet you are.

110
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:13,715
So for your bureaucratic nightmare,

111
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:16,132
you can always hire lobbyists.
That takes time.

112
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,007
Which I don't have.

113
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:20,923
Come on.
Give me the good stuff.

114
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:23,631
Sister to sister.

115
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:26,216
<i>♪ Over and over again ♪</i>

116
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:31,715
Well...

117
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:35,339
if you really want to
cut through red tape,

118
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,590
I may have a guy.

119
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:39,590
Go on.

120
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,798
His name is John Baylor.

121
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,590
Former MI-6
turned Beltway fixer.

122
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,673
Think of him as a sort of
unofficial lobbyist

123
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:49,798
who can apply pressure
to the right people.

124
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,007
Your infrastructure,
my contacts.

125
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:55,549
A rising tide raises all ships.
Isn't that what they say?

126
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,174
Look, I get it.

127
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:05,757
You respond to strength,
and so do I.

128
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:08,381
So let me show you what
having your back looks like.

129
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:11,841
Baylor's a bit eccentric,
but effective.

130
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,339
Just call this number,
and you should know...

131
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,757
hiring him can come at a cost.

132
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,173
Believe me, I can afford it.

133
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,798
I'm not talking money.

134
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:27,007
In DC, secrets
are currency, babe.

135
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,506
He's got dirt on everyone who
gets into business with him.

136
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:33,339
Rumor has it he has
a kind of black book,

137
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,757
but this one's full
of blackmail.

138
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:38,215
You don't say.

139
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,548
That's the car.

140
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:45,007
The guy I saw right after
the money drop.

141
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,007
Well unfortunately,
this is the only security cam

142
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:48,965
in the area.
Hopefully one of these images

143
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,631
can give us a full plate.

144
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:52,631
Once we ID Daphne's
new revenue stream,

145
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:54,673
we can finally get inside
her operation.

146
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,673
And find out why she's still
slumming it in Baltimore

147
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:59,506
while Connor's sipping
margaritas in Mexico.

148
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,173
That car's gotta
still be out there.

149
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:03,382
We just need a better angle.
What about that one?

150
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,048
Are you about to ask me
what I think you about to ask?

151
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,008
Mason, enhance.

152
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,423
There it is. Dodge Charger,
Maryland plate.

153
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:19,840
Foxtrot, echo, 9, 4, 9, 2, November.

154
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:21,757
Reported stolen a few weeks ago.

155
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,381
Okay.

156
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:25,673
Okay, so he used it for the job,

157
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:27,131
ditched it after the drop.

158
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:28,548
Pull up all body shops and

159
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,923
salvage yards within
a 50-mile radius.

160
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:33,215
He can't hide forever.

161
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,715
<i>Charlie.</i>

162
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,590
Otto, hey. Did you chop that
car from the last job yet?

163
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,506
The Charger? Still here.

164
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,506
<i>Why, you wanna take it
for another spin?</i>

165
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:45,089
No. Look,
scratch chopping it, okay?

166
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,548
I need you to crush it.

167
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,465
Bro, that's cutting into
my bottom line.

168
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,381
I can't sell car parts
if the car's crushed.

169
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,548
No, no, no. Stop, stop.

170
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,465
I need you to hear me
on this, okay?

171
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,381
It's gotta disappear.
You got it?

172
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:58,548
You're killing me, man,
but fine.

173
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,089
I'll make it up to you.

174
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,089
Yup.

175
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:04,924
Is that about the car?

176
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:10,715
Why are you so worried
all of a sudden?

177
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:12,923
Just being careful.

178
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:14,840
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

179
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,715
Tell mom to keep Ollie

180
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:18,673
at Uncle Gio's another
couple days.

181
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,132
I just... I want the dust
to settle on this last job.

182
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,506
Sure.
Um...

183
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:27,047
yeah, speaking of, uh,

184
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,798
our least favorite regular
just walked in.

185
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:33,173
Please, sir,
can I have some more?

186
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:35,089
Sorry, you want us to con a spy?

187
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,715
Ex-spy.

188
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,381
He's got a little black book
that could prove useful to me.

189
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:41,423
You know what, lady?
I'm getting a little tired

190
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:44,631
of you and your demands.
Our debt is paid to you.

191
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,256
- Easy, Pop.
- Wrong.

192
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:49,298
Because now, thanks to you,
Connor and I are in a footrace

193
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,173
to control this organization.

194
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:54,548
And now, he's in Mexico with
a $10 million head start.

195
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,089
- Thanks to us?
- Don't play innocent with me.

196
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,631
I know you brought him in
to undermine me.

197
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:01,548
Family drama's
really not our problem.

198
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,173
Yes, it is, because
Connor wants you dead.

199
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:06,923
Your family too.

200
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:10,174
And I'm the only one standing
in the way of that happening.

201
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,798
Okay, so...

202
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,841
we steal a little black book.

203
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,715
Lay it on us.

204
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:26,757
It belongs to a fixer
named John Baylor.

205
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:29,715
The guy is hired by politicians
to clean up their messes,

206
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,631
ruin their enemies,
pay off whistle-blowers.

207
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:34,548
- You want his blackmail.
- Now you're catching on.

208
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:36,757
I like not being dead.

209
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:39,590
What's the real value
in this for you? Hmm?

210
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:42,089
I mean, you deal with
criminals, not politicians.

211
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,757
Is there a difference?

212
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,214
Look, if you're, um,

213
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,214
worried about
your little moral code,

214
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:51,257
no one is in it
who isn't already dirty.

215
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:55,007
That's how you reach Baylor.

216
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,465
You want us to go after
a real-life James Bond

217
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,089
with nothing to go on
but a phone number.

218
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,715
He's a paranoid,
Cold War relic

219
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,590
with no connection to the world.

220
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,049
It's fun, right?

221
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,882
See? I knew you'd like
a challenge.

222
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:15,924
Good luck, Nicolettis.
You're gonna need it.

223
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:28,089
All right, John Baylor,

224
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,798
former agent for MI6, allegedly.

225
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,757
In the late aughts, he was
undercover as a professor

226
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,214
at Thornton College
until the dean blew his cover.

227
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:38,298
MI6 disavows him,
sends out a burn notice,

228
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:40,048
revokes his passport,
whole nine.

229
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:41,506
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

230
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,173
That's all we got?

231
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:46,089
Guess I didn't need
to bring out the board.

232
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,381
Guy's trained to be invisible.

233
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:48,673
He knows how to cover
his tracks.

234
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:49,882
And now, he's using those skills

235
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,882
to profit off of DC's dirtiest.

236
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,048
It's always nice to see
someone land on their feet.

237
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:55,882
Hey, Pop, did you get
anything on the ground

238
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:57,798
that would lead us back
to this guy's black book?

239
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,256
Turns out that spying on a spy

240
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:02,339
is as difficult as you'd expect.

241
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,465
I mean, this guy's
tradecraft is top notch.

242
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,173
He meets his clients
in public places

243
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,881
where it's either
too loud to listen

244
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,548
or too empty
to get close to him.

245
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:14,298
He uses surveillance detection
routes to run his errands.

246
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,298
Okay, so the usual tricks
aren't gonna work.

247
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,798
We're just gonna have to
lure him to us.

248
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,048
Ooh, you mean hire him.

249
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,715
Buddy of mine at the Drakefield

250
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:23,631
said that one Ray Tipton Jr.'s
checking out tomorrow morning.

251
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,298
- RTJ?
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:28,964
Oh, he's a worse human than
his dad was a vice-president.

253
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:31,007
It's all over the tabloids.

254
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,465
What? You never stood in line
at the grocery store?

255
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,673
Well, hey, look, I'm thinking
that RTJ had a wild night

256
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:39,465
that he's gonna want buried.

257
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,631
So we slip Baylor a phone
with some delicious blackmail.

258
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,256
Give him some more dirt
for his collection.

259
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:45,131
Along with some malware
that would give me access

260
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:46,881
to his computer
and all his files.

261
00:11:46,882 --> 00:11:48,840
And then his secrets
become our secrets.

262
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,799
That's good.

263
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,382
Can't hire a fixer without
breaking something.

264
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:00,298
Oh, I've always wanted
to do this.

265
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,466
Batter up!

266
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,006
- Explain that to me!
- No, don't blame this on me.

267
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,548
Hurry, before anyone hears.

268
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,298
I didn't see your name
on the partner rolls

269
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,798
at Skadden or Latham.

270
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,839
I've got my own shingle.

271
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,131
Do you have the money?

272
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:22,089
I am so sick
of you bringing us down.

273
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,298
You just barge right in.

274
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,673
Oh, yeah? Maybe if Ray
wasn't such a lying piece...

275
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:29,214
You just talking, talking,
but you never say anything.

276
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,048
You're talking at me.
Don't talk to me.

277
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:32,798
Who the hell are you?

278
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:36,256
Excuse me. Hello?

279
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,506
I said who the hell are you?

280
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,881
Oh, let me guess, Ray sent
another man to manipulate me.

281
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:43,465
Oh, it's like I said.
It's just like I said, man.

282
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,964
- She's gonna be a problem.
- I'm the problem?

283
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,423
She's gonna sing like a canary.

284
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:49,131
Canary?
What are you, an ornithologist

285
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,381
- all of a sudden?
- You know, you're a walking

286
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,797
contact high.

287
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:53,673
- You, shut up.
- I...

288
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:55,548
Shut up.

289
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:58,049
Why don't you all shut up?

290
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:01,049
What are we dealing with?

291
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:04,506
Things got a little messy
for my client last night.

292
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,006
I need you to make it go away.

293
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:08,381
Make it go away?
I came here to be with

294
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:11,298
my boyfriend, and he left
this morning with some hooker.

295
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,673
Takes one to know one, huh?

296
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:15,256
Look, she's got photos.
I need you to keep her

297
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:17,339
from leaking anything
to the tabloids.

298
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,881
You, clean that up and
whatever else you've snorted.

299
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,173
You, replace the sheets.

300
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:24,797
- You.
- Seriously?

301
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,756
I mean, we hired you.

302
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:29,214
Now, I am literally cleaning
up that cheater's mess.

303
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,507
Don't make me ask again.

304
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:40,922
So we're looking good.

305
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:42,797
Poll numbers are up.
Money's coming in.

306
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:45,423
But this line's heading
in the wrong direction.

307
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,631
Oh, that's David's approval
with the 18 to 29s.

308
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:49,465
Now, we tried to engage,

309
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,881
but it's hard to get Gen Z to
care about the real issues.

310
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,121
Yeah, maybe with that attitude.

311
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,381
Thank you, Ms. West,
but that's not...

312
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:59,090
Let's hear what she has to say.

313
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:06,631
Well, I couldn't help but
notice that you don't have

314
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,214
a dedicated
social media strategist,

315
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,548
and your Twitter feed
shows how well that's going.

316
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,131
Platitudes and infographics?
Blah.

317
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,881
Social media
isn't just about communication.

318
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:17,256
It's about connection.

319
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,131
For example, Doug, right now
I just know you as

320
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:23,381
David's campaign manager,
but when I saw that you spent

321
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:26,922
last Friday night front row
at the Bad Bunny concert,

322
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:29,798
well, now we're connecting
as people.

323
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,256
So what do you suggest
we do next?

324
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:35,381
TikTok, Instagram.

325
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,382
You're a charming guy.
Let's use that.

326
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:42,089
David's a politician,
not an influencer.

327
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,339
I'd argue
they're one in the same.

328
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,673
She's not wrong.

329
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:49,673
Uh, would you give us a moment?

330
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,131
Where'd this new aide come from?

331
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:58,881
Don't tell me Claire Fox
introduced her to you.

332
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:01,714
Yeah, well, Claire helps
shore up political support

333
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,423
from some of our donors,
and I...

334
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,757
Did her a favor.

335
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:08,006
I really wish you'd told me.

336
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,423
It's not a big deal, Dad. Really.

337
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,256
Plus, Jen has some good ideas.

338
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:17,964
Just don't assume
she's working for you.

339
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:21,257
When it comes to Claire Fox,
there's always another agenda.

340
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:32,381
Oh, I not gonna let you
sweep this under the rug.

341
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:34,714
I am gonna take these pictures
straight to TMZ.

342
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:36,756
Come on. Is that necessary?

343
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:38,922
Treat Ray Ray with
the respect he treated me.

344
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:39,964
If you do that, the only person

345
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:41,630
that will get hurt is you.

346
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,173
It doesn't matter what he did.

347
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:45,047
The woman pays the price. Always.

348
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:48,048
Which is why you're gonna
take this money.

349
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,797
And you're gonna
forget everything

350
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:53,591
that's happened here today.

351
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,339
Uh, I gotta...
I gotta take this.

352
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,256
I'm gonna take... I'm gonna
take this, yeah.

353
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,381
- Hey, what's up?
<i>- You were right.</i>

354
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,298
Some government suits
are here asking questions.

355
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,131
Well, you already took care
of that thing, right?

356
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,506
<i>I was getting to it, bro.
I'm slammed.</i>

357
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,131
Where is it now?

358
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,964
The car is on the north side
of the yard.

359
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:19,672
I'll give them the grand tour.

360
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,756
That should buy you enough
time to do what you gotta do.

361
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:23,339
Okay, yeah.
I'll be right there.

362
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,506
Hey, uh, so... ha.

363
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:28,006
I've got a friend
who has a car emergency.

364
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:29,590
- Uh, I gotta go now.
- Wait.

365
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:37,006
Do you idiots ever have a day
without a crisis? Huh?

366
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:38,964
Cut him loose.
We don't need him here anyway.

367
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:39,964
Good riddance, Dick.

368
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:42,715
Go.

369
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,881
Now, hand the man your phone

370
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,321
so we can all move on
with our lives.

371
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:51,882
Thank you.

372
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:00,006
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the photos?

373
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,922
Insurance. You don't pay
the rest of my fee

374
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,547
or you decide to disclose
my involvement here,

375
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,381
these go public.

376
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:08,256
Oh.

377
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,714
What are you doing?

378
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:12,381
That's the only proof I have
or RTJ and his whore.

379
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,881
Hey, wait.

380
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:16,964
You can't have digital
evidence floating around.

381
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,631
You never know
who can get to it.

382
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:22,922
Uh...

383
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,256
Well, I wish I could say
it's been a pleasure.

384
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,506
But it never is.

385
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,006
Wait.

386
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,881
You need to give me a ride.

387
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:42,797
I would call one,
but you just nuked my phone.

388
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,089
Or I could catch a ride with

389
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,090
one of the paparazzi downstairs.

390
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:52,299
I thought you had this
all sewn up.

391
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,715
Fine. Come with me.

392
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,630
Can we take a look over here?

393
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,089
That's where I park my junkers.

394
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,797
It wouldn't be down there.

395
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:23,798
Yeah, I'd still like
to take a look.

396
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:34,882
Oh.

397
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:38,964
It's Charlie.

398
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:40,423
Mm, I'll call him back.

399
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:41,547
No, go ahead and take it.

400
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,423
These cars aren't going anywhere.

401
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:44,465
True.

402
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:49,298
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

403
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,714
I know you're at work,
I'm sorry.

404
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,339
I just, uh...

405
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,131
I wanted to hear your voice.

406
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,630
What's going on?
Stuff with the bar?

407
00:18:56,631 --> 00:19:00,214
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

408
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:01,714
<i>Hey, I was thinking...</i>

409
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:04,547
what about a little stay-cation?

410
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,965
Tonight, escape for a few hours
just you and me.

411
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:11,672
- Yeah, that sounds great.
<i>- Great.</i>

412
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,214
Meet me at the Langston
at 8:00.

413
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:15,131
Yeah, okay. I'll be there.

414
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:17,382
It's a date. See you soon.

415
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:27,756
What do you think?

416
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,465
Looks familiar.

417
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:38,299
I wasn't using him, you know?

418
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:42,131
I mean, the parties were fun.

419
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,589
The lifestyle.

420
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,505
I didn't come from much, but...

421
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,965
I really thought
we had something.

422
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:53,339
And now,
I just feel like a fool.

423
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,505
You were right, what you said.

424
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:58,590
That the woman
always pays the price.

425
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:03,132
A word of advice.

426
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:07,590
It may be hard, but let
the past stay the past.

427
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:14,173
Bet you see a lotta people
with regrets

428
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:15,923
in your line of work.

429
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:20,049
Hey, what are you gonna do
with those photographs?

430
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:26,090
I'm asking 'cause I got a kid,
and I really don't...

431
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,464
I don't know who you are
or what you're angling for,

432
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,215
but your sob story needs work.

433
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,547
Get out.

434
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:48,380
Don't ever call me again,
and remember,

435
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,965
I have more on you
than you have on me.

436
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:57,590
<i>And you just slide
the pancake onto the plate.</i>

437
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,964
<i>And boom.</i>

438
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,922
<i>You're done.</i>

439
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:06,381
<i>My dad always called this
the dinner of champions.</i>

440
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,256
Sorry, that was lame.

441
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:12,547
Can we go again?

442
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:14,797
It was great.

443
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,964
The whole point is connecting
over the little things.

444
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,589
Hey, you wanna try some?

445
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,465
I can't let good kimchi-jeon
go to waste.

446
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:33,547
Go for it.

447
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:35,131
Just like that.
Yup. Perfect.

448
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,506
Ah!
Okay.

449
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:38,464
And dip.

450
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:45,965
Mm, mm.

451
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,007
It's hot.

452
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,297
Hope I didn't, uh,

453
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,297
step on any toes
with your team before.

454
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:04,422
I know they only think
I'm here as a favor.

455
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:08,089
Hey, I chose to hire you.

456
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,464
I just have a hard time believing

457
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,589
people really want me
at the table.

458
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,297
The truth is,
I got most of my jobs

459
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:15,715
from my parents
calling in favors.

460
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:21,380
Listen, I still doubt
I'm here because I earned it.

461
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,255
And sometimes I think
even my own team

462
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:26,339
doesn't see me for who I am
or what I've done.

463
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:30,964
My parents could've got me
on any campaign,

464
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:32,797
and I chose yours

465
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:34,839
because of who you are.

466
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,797
Because I believe in you.

467
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,214
Maybe it's time the rest of
the team sees the real you.

468
00:22:42,423 --> 00:22:44,132
I certainly like him.

469
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,380
No, Pop, what I said is
for like ten seconds,

470
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:50,589
I thought he made me.

471
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,006
You shouldn't have improvised.

472
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:54,839
- We had a plan.
- Didn't work, right?

473
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,464
We had one shot with Baylor.
I took it.

474
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:58,714
- But that's how you get hurt.
- Hey.

475
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,048
- How'd it go?
- Oh, it's fine.

476
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,464
It's gonna be fine.
I swapped the plate,

477
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,505
and then I called your boy
over at Customs Office

478
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:06,006
to make sure the new plate
pings far, far from Baltimore.

479
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:08,089
Good. That should keep
the feds off our asses.

480
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,756
Hey, how'd it go with Baylor?
He take the bait?

481
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:13,672
Um, so he nuked the phone
before we got out of the room,

482
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,672
but I was able to talk
my way into his car.

483
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,213
- He almost made her.
- No, he didn't.

484
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:19,797
- It was fine. I'm fine.
- He almost made her.

485
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,547
I shouldn't have left.
No, I could've handled that.

486
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:25,006
Hey, I handled it,
and I got something.

487
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:26,797
Whoo! Yay, Bird.

488
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,839
Okay, so he had this key.

489
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,006
Make was Belson.
Printed on it was RMO32.

490
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,672
So I gave it to my guy Stosh
to see what businesses

491
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,630
in the area use that brand
and that locker model.

492
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:39,547
Because before
he nuked the phone,

493
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,297
he took all of these
photos of the blackmail

494
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:42,797
with this old-school spy camera.

495
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,630
- The guy's a total Luddite.
- So wait a minute.

496
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,130
So you're thinking that
Baylor's black book

497
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:47,505
is actually physical,
not digital.

498
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:51,630
Yeah and hidden
in one of these lockers.

499
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:54,757
Ready to look for a needle
in a very large haystack?

500
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:59,172
Oh, my God.

501
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:02,255
Okay, look, um,

502
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:05,255
I had plans with Emma,
so let me call her and cancel.

503
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:06,797
And then we'll roll
our sleeves up and get going.

504
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,505
Stop. Whoa.

505
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,048
Go spend time
with your girlfriend.

506
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,130
Yeah. We'll tag you
back in tomorrow.

507
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:13,548
We got this.

508
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:16,923
Okay.
Thanks.

509
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:24,381
- I'm fine, Pop.
- Shouldn't have improvised.

510
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,297
Nothing on the Charger.

511
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,130
But now I got some ideas
for my next car lease.

512
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:32,630
- This is a sexy car.
- You know what?

513
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:34,338
Let's call it.

514
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,297
You should go home,
and I don't wanna be late.

515
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:38,381
Hot date with Charlie?

516
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:42,172
Guess he got over the polygraph.

517
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:45,256
Yeah, he took it surprisingly
well, all things considered.

518
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,797
Border patrol
found that license plate

519
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:51,589
you were looking for
abandoned outside El Paso.

520
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,964
You think our mystery man

521
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:54,630
ditched the plates
before crossing the border?

522
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:56,630
Yeah, you've been saying
that the revenue stream

523
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:58,213
would uncover
the Maguires' next move.

524
00:24:58,214 --> 00:24:59,881
And this confirms our intel

525
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:02,047
that Connor is making in-runs
with the cartels.

526
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:04,047
We'll need to relocate
some personnel.

527
00:25:04,048 --> 00:25:05,881
- Relocate?
- Yeah.

528
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:09,213
I'm gonna make a recommendation
that you oversee the operation.

529
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:11,423
I hear great things
about our Juárez station.

530
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:19,006

an international operation,

531
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:20,505

532
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:22,965

finishing my bucket list.

I wouldn't have hesitated.

00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:49,630

You don't need to explain.

589
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:18,547
- It's fine. Totally fine.
- It's...

590
00:28:18,548 --> 00:28:19,672
- No, it's so fine.
- No, no, no, no.

591

I-it's not fine. Emma...

592
00:28:22,173 --> 00:28:23,630
- I'm gonna go.
- Please don't go.

593
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:26,672
- Please, Emma, just stay.
- No.

594
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,757
I'm not gonna stay.

595
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:34,590
Bye, Charlie.

596
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:52,506
- Hey.
- Hey.

597
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,005
Aren't you, uh, supposed to be

598
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:57,547
waking up in silk sheets
right about now?

599
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:00,046
No, hotel switched
to pima cotton.

600
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:02,422
Wasn't digging the thread count.

601
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:03,423
Mm-hmm.

602
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:09,589
Night ended early.

603
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,839
- You getting a fresh pot?
- Yeah, sure.

604
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,380
Hey, so where're we at
with Baylor's black book?

605
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:22,963
- What'd I miss?
- Uh, Pop and I got through

606
00:29:22,964 --> 00:29:24,714
about half the list last night.

607
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:29,338
There's still 214 buildings to
go with 32 or more lockers.

608
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,672
You wanna split it up?

609
00:29:30,673 --> 00:29:32,630
I'll take Northeast DC.
You take Northwest.

610
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,880
First, how 'bout you tell me
why you been lying to me.

611
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:36,338
Yeah, okay.

612
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,589
You've been weird.
I've been patient.

613
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,130
Hey, Bird, we're all going
through a lot right now.

614
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:42,046
Oh, stop it.

615
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,881
You're my brother.
What's going on?

616
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:51,338
Hmm. Emma.

617
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:53,797
I don't think
it's gonna work out.

618
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:56,006
Why? What happened?

619
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,838
We're just too different.

620
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,255
She don't know about
any of this.

621
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:03,797
I don't like hiding it from her.

622
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:10,046
Yeah.
Gotta let it go though.

623
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:13,006
Whatever we had,
it's in the past.

624
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:17,173
Let the past stay the past.

625
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:20,963
What's that?

626
00:30:20,964 --> 00:30:22,964
I think I know where to find
Baylor's black book.

627
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:32,464
It's my decision to make.

628
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:34,797
Because I'm the candidate,
not my father.

629
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,506
We can discuss this later.

630
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,838
I heard you come home
last night.

631
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,756
What happened to
your stay-cation?

632
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:47,672
I think we're done.

633
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:49,006
Why? What happened?

634
00:30:52,465 --> 00:30:53,673
I said the I word.

635
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:57,839
And Charlie didn't say it back.

636
00:31:00,797 --> 00:31:03,423
It just... sorta came out,
but I...

637
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,796
Still thought he would...

638
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:08,963
I mean, I literally
read people for a living.

639
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:11,380
How could I have been so off?

640
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,256
I was so sure it was real.

641
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:17,631
I finally let someone in.

642
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,465
I am really sorry, Em.

643
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:28,838
Yeah.

644
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,381
Me too.

645
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:33,796
Thornton's campus.

646
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,547
Baylor spent years there
undercover as a professor.

647
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:39,464
Minutes away from his fat cat
clients on Capitol Hill.

648
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,130
He'd know the place
inside and out.

649
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,713
So remember Baylor's key
had RM printed on it.

650
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:46,130
Guess which library
has 50 thesis lockers

651
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:48,921
that use that same key?
Reim Memorial.

652
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:52,590
Oh, it looks like
your Hail Mary paid off, Bird.

653
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:58,464
I'll dust off Professor Bloom
so I can keep guard.

654
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:00,172
I think I still got that
tweed jacket

655
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:02,380
- laying around here somewhere.
- I miss that guy.

656
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,880
- He still teaching astronomy?
- Russian history.

657
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,505
Reading a lot of Trotsky lately.

658
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,921
He's a fascinating man.

659
00:32:07,922 --> 00:32:10,046
Okay, so while
Professor Pinko's keeping

660
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:12,088
an eye on the door,
all we gotta do

661
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:14,505
is pick Baylor's lock,
copy the black book,

662
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:16,088
and then put it back before
he ever knew we were there.

663
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:17,713
Oh, is that all?

Look.

670
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:10,838
You gotta be kidding me.
It's just a box of microfiche?

671
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,297
I mean,
we knew he was old-school,

672
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:14,213
but this is ancient.

673
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:15,796
He must shrink it down
to make it easier to hide.

674
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:17,963
So how're we gonna copy it?

675
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:21,172
Uh... there was a scanner
that we passed.

676
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:23,380
It'll let me dump it
onto a flash drive.

677
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:24,755
- It's gonna take a while.
- All right.

678
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,756
Then let's get goin'.

679
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:46,172
Oh, no, no.
But the thing about Lenin

680
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:47,921
is that he was always
jealous of Trotsky,

681
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:50,629
because Trotsky
had the gift of gab.

682
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,381
I'm tellin' ya, if the
Astrodome had been around...

683
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,255
Trotsky would've packed it.

684
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:59,464
He had presence.

685
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:01,796
Yeah, uh, excuse me a minute.

686
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:04,130
<i>Baylor's incoming.
Got about 20 seconds.</i>

687
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:05,713
I'll distract him.
You keep going.

688
00:34:05,714 --> 00:34:07,713
Hey, Charlie, he's armed.

689
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,473
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's why I gotta do this.

690
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:40,173
That should give you time.

691
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:11,048
Hey, Bird, Dad, you guys clear?

692
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,755
<i>Hey, I'm in.
I'm in the van.</i>

693
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,546
Okay. I'll meet you
outside then.

694
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:20,547
Hey, pal.

695
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,839
Hello again.

696
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:28,838
I believe you came
to take something of mine,

697
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,588
so I thought
I'd take something of yours.

698
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:37,629
You know, there's an easier way

699
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,130
to register for my class.

700
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,796
Let him go.

701
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:43,047
Who? Your father here?

702
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:45,088
I thought so.

703
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:47,588
I take it that was your sister
in my car as well.

704
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,379
Family of criminals.
Holidays must be a delight.

705
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,796
Hey, Pop, Charlie, you keep
him talking, all right?

706
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:53,546
<i>I'm gonna find us
something we can use.</i>

707
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,337
You calling us criminals?

708
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,255
People pay you
to fix their problems,

709
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,337
an then you steal their secrets
for blackmail?

710
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:01,713
Cost of doing business;
if my clients really wanted to

711
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:03,213
protect themselves,
they'd have no secrets.

712
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:05,130
Everybody's
hiding something, pal.

713
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,963
Except you.

714
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:09,255
No, someone spilled your secret.

715
00:37:09,256 --> 00:37:11,463
How's it feel to be disavowed
by your country?

716
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:13,921
Having my cover blown
left me with nothing to hide.

717
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:16,172
<i>Unlike you, I have nothing
that makes me vulnerable.</i>

718
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:18,005
<i>What's your play here?</i>

719
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:20,297
Steal my collateral
to make a buck?

720
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,588
I'd like to steal
that gun of yours

721
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:22,838
and stick it up your...

722
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,048
Oh!

723
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:31,421
You okay?

724
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:32,922
Yeah.

725
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,629
It's all there.

726
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,088
Even so...

727
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:45,629
I can't let you out of here
knowing what you know.

728
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,005
<i>Hey, Charlie,
I think I got something.</i>

729
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:50,713
Those books in Baylor's locker
were written by the wife

730
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:51,838
<i>of the dean who blew his cover.</i>

731
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,047
- <i>She's his secret.</i>
- Katherine Moss.

732
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:57,421
She's the reason
you got burned, right?

733
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:59,588
You two were having an affair,

734
00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:02,504
and when her husband found out,
he was the one who exposed you.

735
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:04,671
But you're still carrying
a torch for her.

736
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:06,048
It's romantic, really.

737
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:10,047
You think I care about her?

738
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:12,671
The past is the past.

739
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,629
Then why are you keeping
the books she gave you

740
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,005
in your locker?

741
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:19,588
Okay, Charlie, I found her.
She lives at 39...

742
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,422
44 Brandywine.

743
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:25,005
That's where she lives
with her husband, the dean.

744
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:27,713
- Right?
- Don't you dare go near her.

745
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:31,838
As long as you stay clear of
us, she's gonna be fine.

746
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,337
But the second I sniff you
anywhere nearby...

747
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:38,254
I'm gonna let all
your enemies know

748
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,255
where to find her.

749
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,006
Deal?

750
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:57,839
Deal.

751
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,546
Good morning, everyone.

752
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:05,463
I wanted to introduce you
to your new

753
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:07,671
Director of Social Media,
Jennifer West.

754
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:09,337
- Hey.
- Hey, Jen.

755
00:39:09,338 --> 00:39:13,796
I have complete faith in Jen,
and I know you all will too.

756
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:15,713
We need to stop making assumptions

757
00:39:15,714 --> 00:39:18,588
and see each other
for who we really are.

758
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,212
That goes double for voters.

759
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:23,672
Together, we can bring
real change to Washington.

760
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:28,380
And let's get to work.

761
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:38,463
Nice digs.

762
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:40,212
I know, right?

763
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:42,713
I acquired it from
some new business partners.

764
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,171
You see, Charlie?

765
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:47,005
Cooperation has its benefits.

766
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,338
Yeah.

767
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:51,797
Got you what you needed.

768
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,755
So much power
in the palm of my hand.

769
00:39:56,756 --> 00:39:58,629
This should take off, what,

770
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,088
2 million off your debt,
let's say?

771
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:03,212
Debt, right.
That's between you and Connor.

772
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:04,880
You're lucky
I'm feeling generous,

773
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:06,629
considering
the information on here

774
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,838
solves your problems
as much as mine.

775
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,379
- How would it do that?
- Well,

776
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,212
the feds spotted you
handing stolen cash

777
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:17,713
to a drug dealer you brought
stateside, so... yes.

778
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:19,714
You might need
some dirty politicians.

779
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,796
You got a particular
scumbag in mind,

780
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,838
or did you just nearly get
my family and I killed

781
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,546
for a fishing expedition?

782
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:29,796
All you need to know
is the blackmail on here

783
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,756
will get the feds off
both of our trails for good.

784
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:37,421
I took care of that drop car.

785
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,171
All right?
They not on to us anymore.

786
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:42,047
I don't think you understand
who we're up against.

787
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:44,671
There's this little
CIA spook... she's smart.

788
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:47,714
Tenacious.
A real caped crusader.

789
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:53,171
But lucky for us, her family
isn't quite so principled.

790
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:56,629
Politicians, am I right?

791
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,421
I bet a threat to her family

792
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:04,297
will put a nice little dent
in her can-do spirit.

793
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:12,005
Emma.

794
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,796
What are you doing here?

795
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:15,671
We need to talk.

796
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,504
Nothing more to say.

797
00:41:17,505 --> 00:41:20,297
Hey, Daphne Finch
is coming for you.

798
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:24,255
How do you know that name?

799
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:28,130
Because I'm working for her.

800
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:32,337
Oh, my God.

801
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:34,629
It's you... the guy in the mask.

802
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,504
Look, she's got dirt
on your family,

803
00:41:36,505 --> 00:41:39,546
and she intends to use it
against you, Emma.

804
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:42,172
Why are you telling me this?
