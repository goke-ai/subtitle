1
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:42,075
- Mr. Maguire.

2
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,826
At last, we meet.

3
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:44,911
- Pleasure.

4
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,955
My son was impressed
with your offer.

5
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:50,250
And given what I'm
looking at, so am I.

6
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,293
<i>- Oh, he's got a
voice for radio, huh?</i>

7
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:54,337
I'm such a sucker
for an Irish accent,

8
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:55,338
even on a gangster.

9
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,798
<i>- ♪ Oh ♪</i>

10
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,967

11

<i>- ♪ You're gonna
lose your soul ♪</i>

12
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:03,888
<i>- All right, Charlie, it's
time to work your magic.</i>

13
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,349
- Please, right this way.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,101
<i>- ♪ You're gonna

15
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,228
- How are we looking?

16
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,189
- Well, it's not the
paperwork that worries me.

17
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,025
What's odd is his willingness
to sell us this warehouse

18
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:18,611
at a discount, take
crypto over cash.

19
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:25,743
- Respectfully, only one reason
folks in your line of work

20
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:27,912
want to buy a warehouse near
the port under the table,

21
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:31,374
and it's not exactly legal.

22
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,501
- I forgot, how did
you say you and Connor

23
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:35,169
came to know one another?

24
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,297
- Oh, I didn't.

25
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,719
I'm sorry. I don't
know who she is.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,847
My deal's with your son.

27
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:47,765
- Mr. Maguire, can we talk?

28
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,354
- What's going on?

29
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,772
- We need to walk.

30
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:58,985
<i>- Hey, this could be a problem.</i>

31
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,447
She's trying to get him to walk.

32
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:11,497
The hell do you
think you're going?

33
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,000
- I didn't realize she was
the one calling the shots.

34
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,043
- She's not.

35
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,254
- Could have fooled me.

36
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:24,469
- Enough.

37
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,471
Let's get on with it.

38
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,323
- I'll need to
confirm the funds.

39
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,123
OK.

40
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:55,625
Sign the transfer of ownership,

41
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:57,085
and we are...
- Shh.

42
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:58,252
Chopper.

43
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:00,713
We
got to go... now!

44
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,715
Put it back!

45
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,300
Put it back!

46
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,178
- Did you set me up?
Did you set me up?

47
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,771
- FBI! On the ground... now!

48
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:19,399
On the ground!

49
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:34,622
That was a lot of mustard
on that sandwich, Pop.

50
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:37,125
- What?

51
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:38,292
I've got to commit to sell it.

52
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,502
- Ah, I think you oversold it.

53
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,254
- Here! Let me.

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,465
Did you get it?

55
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:45,675
- Yeah.

56
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,717
Of course I got it.

57
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:49,762
Mm.

58
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,639
- I'm thinking we keep
these for the honeymoon.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,933
- Oh, Jesus. Unsubscribe.
- Oh, yeah.

60
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,101
- At least he's
in a relationship.

61
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,394
- You know what, Mom?

62
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:58,479
I am the only reason
you have a grandchild.

63
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,607
- Hey, great timing
on that chopper.

64
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,317
- Yeah, the words
"rooftop" and "sniper"

65
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:05,653
put a real pep in the
step of the Baltimore PD.

66
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,363
- 621, Pop.
- Right, right.

67
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,614
- 621.
- Yeah, yeah.

68
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,615
Yeah, right. I got it.

69
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,450
I got it. I got it.

70
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:14,579
- Hey, let's get out of
here before they realize

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,789
they were buying a
warehouse we didn't own.

72
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,042
- Look, I get it.

73
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,044
By this point in my life,
I should have two kids

74
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,796
and a husband on
the partner track.

75
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,006
But guess what, Mom.

76
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,633
I'm not you.

77
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,928
She's reminding me of my
geriatric pregnancy years.

78
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:33,306
Yeah, well, Kevin's
been working late a lot,

79
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,599
so I doubt he'll make it.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,476
But I will ask,
promise.

81
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm getting called
into a meeting, Mom.

82
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,146
Got to go. I'll
talk to you later.

83
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,783
- You're welcome.

84
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,452
- What am I thanking you for?

85
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:55,953
- That signal in the noise
you were looking for?

86
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,497
I think we found it.

87
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,751
I knew it.

88
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:04,086
- Wherever one of these
distribution hubs pop up,

89
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:07,882
a spike in fentanyl
overdoses soon follows.

90
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:10,468
You're looking at the
largest drug trafficking ring

91
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:12,094
in Europe, hiding in plain sight

92
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,931
behind a series of shills
and numbered corporations.

93
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,807
And if I'm right,
they're about to make

94
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,851
a big push into the U. S.

95
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,063
- So we know the what and
the how, just not the who.

96
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:24,273
- Not just yet, but now
I know where to look.

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,912
<i>Room service!</i>

98
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:40,373
- Ordered us the good stuff.

99
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,874
Emma!

100
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,876
Hey, wait! You can't
just barge in here!

101
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,919
Emma, what are you doing here?

102
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,045
Emma!

103
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,631
- Oh, my God.

104
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:51,342
Are you cheating on me?

105
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:53,010
- Nice.

106
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,345
<i>How long?</i>

107
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,097
Must have been a while.

108
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:58,516
Stacy seemed pretty torn up.

109
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:00,726
- Three months.

110
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,770
- Why not just tell me?

111
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,233
- Oh, come on, Em.

112
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,444
Can you honestly say that
you're in love with me?

113
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,367
- I can't believe
we pulled that off.

114
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,743
You were amazing back there.

115
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,745
- We were amazing. Hey,
you ready to celebrate?

116
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,871
Because somebody
might have booked

117
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:22,541
the penthouse suite
at the Langston.

118
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:28,421
- By this time tomorrow,
we'll be en route to Italy.

119
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,172
- And then?

120
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,883
- Whatever we want till
the money runs out.

121
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,303
Hey.

122
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:37,471
You know the best part
about happily ever after?

123
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:40,224
- I don't know, discovering
that it actually exists?

124
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,726
- Mm.

125
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,686
You don't know what comes next.

126
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,438
- Yeah, yeah.

127
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,439
Hey, ditch the truck. I'll
see you back at the bar.

Let's go.

131
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,295

on a destination yet?

132

133
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,423
and I won't budge on Spain.

134
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:13,674
- Why not both, huh?

135
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:15,301
Repeat after me, son:

136
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,928
marriage is compromise.

We just pulled off the
biggest job of our lives.

140
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,643
I'm sure you can spare
one second to celebrate.

141
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,978
- Yeah, call me conservative.

142
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,231
I like the small
scores, under the radar.

143
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,359
What we just did
makes me nervous.

144
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,777
- You got to gamble big
if you want to win big.

145
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:35,279
- I will celebrate once
I transfer the funds

146
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,947
into the offshore
account I set up.

147
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:39,033
Can you hand me the cold wallet?

148
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,243

00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:51,313

166
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,983
so whatever this is, hard pass.

Oh, I drink mai tais now.

00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,642
it won't be with me.

181
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:30,812
- Cool. Have a good one.

182
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:36,735
- Hawaii sounds nice.

184
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,579
- Relationships.

185
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,248
What a racket.

186
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:53,751
- A shell game to conceal
who you really are.

187
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,170
- It's exhausting, isn't it?

188
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,465
Lying to each
other all the time.

189
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,884
- But not just
lying to each other.

190
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:05,222
I mean... lying to
ourselves, really.

191
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:15,731
Whew.

192
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:17,067
So what happened?

193
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,945
- She lied to me
about who she was.

194
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,154
- Mm.

195
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,698
I'd promise not to
do the same, but...

196
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,201
we both know that'd be a lie.

197
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,415
So what do you do?

198
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,171
- Oh, me? I'm a...

199
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:42,174
I'm a yoga instructor.

200
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,175
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,218
- No man bun?

202
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,511
- I got rid of it last year.

203
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,388
It was attracting the
wrong kind of attention.

204
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:48,973
You?

205
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:51,934

00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,894

rocket scientist.

207
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:55,646
- Mm.
- Turns out, my passion,

208
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:56,606
it was...

209
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,232
Up there the whole time.

210
00:10:58,233 --> 00:10:59,525

pageants really

prepared you for NASA, though.

212
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,279
- Oh, you have no idea.

213
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,864
The only people more
competitive than beauty queens

214
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,657
are those bitches at NASA.

You charged the

235
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:09,923
- Wait.
- What?

236
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:12,258

237
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,760

238
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:18,348

unstructured burger.

- Chaser.

242
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,232
- Bottoms up.

243
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,691
Wait. You have to
look me in the eye.

244
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,735
Otherwise, it's seven
years of bad sex.

245
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:50,923

- Morning.

246
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:35,133

247
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:36,551
- OK.

248
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:40,847
- I reeked of alcohol
and terrible decisions...

249
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:42,557
Not that you were
a bad decision.

250
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:43,683
I mean, we didn't even...

251
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:45,393
- No.

252
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:46,395
No, we didn't.

253
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,946

254
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:58,949
what did you say you do again?

255
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,286
- I'm a classical musician.

256
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,455
- Mm. Piano.

257
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,917
Weirdly, no.

258
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,085
Theremin.

259
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:13,171
- The theremin?

260
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:15,632

261
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,967
it's all electricity.

262
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:19,719
- Hmm.

263
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,347

264
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:42,450

265
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:43,952

266
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:46,537

- Yeah.

267
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,209
A negroni, really?

268
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,963
What? I'm not a gin person.

269
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,339
- Yeah, you're not a gin person

270

271

272

Barroom brawl?

273
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,684
- No, actually.

274
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:09,811
Old roommate of mine

275
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,980
tried to steal my apple.

276
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:14,065
Put a blade in me
before I took it back.

277
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,651
- You almost lost your
life over a piece of fruit?

278
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:18,945
No, not me.

279
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,030
Him.

280

<i>You got to take 'em.</i>

281
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,619

282
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,413
I'm a rule follower.

283
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,584
- See, the idea is

284
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:36,254
to respect the orange.

285
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:40,175
You draw the essence out
without the bitterness.

286
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:45,513
<i>Maybe we just stay
here, do this.</i>

287
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:47,181
- For how long?

288
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:48,558
- Indefinitely.

289
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:54,231
- Fantasy is one thing, Charlie.

290
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:58,360
Reality is another.

291
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:04,824
- Yeah.

292
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,171
- Hey.

293
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,548
Heard about Tina.

294
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,092
Sorry.

295
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,885
- Yeah.

296
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,303
- You were always a
bit of a romantic,

297
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:26,597
even in the seventh grade.

298
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,309
- Look, you said you
got a line on a thing?

299
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,520
'Cause I got to make up
quick for this last one.

300
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:38,191
- Yeah, we had a client,
some high roller from D. C.

301
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,526
You know the type...
Hired some girls,

302
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,903
lots of drinks, a lot
of big swinging...

303
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:43,029
- Yup.

304
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,240
- Anyways, there's
this TV preacher,

305
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:48,284
runs a megachurch in Arlington.

306
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:50,828
One too many drinks,
makes it rain.

307
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:53,706
Big stacks. I noticed.

308
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:56,417
Seemed like the kind of guy
you'd want to know about.

309
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,544
- Yeah, he does.

310
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,338
- Usual deal?

311

329

00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,905
It's early stage,
memory loss. That's it.

360
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:33,366
- Pop.
- We're not...

361
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,951
doing this.

362
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:41,374
So...

363
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,877
this score,

364
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,629
tell me what you're
thinking about.

365
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:51,425
- How do you feel about
taking from the hand of God?

366
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,179
- Oh.

367
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,267
- This is our target:

368
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:10,270
Evan Earle III,
aka Pastor Earle.

369
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,980
- We cannot be late to church.

370
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:14,566
<i>- He's the lead pastor and CEO</i>

371
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,276
<i>of ILLUMIN-8 Fellowship.</i>

372
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:18,445
<i>This guy, he is no angel.</i>

373
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,988
<i>Let's see what he's
hiding in that church.</i>

374
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,782
<i>- ♪ I've been
holdin' out so long ♪</i>

375
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:24,117
<i>♪ I've been
sleepin' all alone ♪</i>

376
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:26,870
<i>♪ Lord, I miss you ♪</i>

377
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,580
- Look at the interior.

378
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,207
It's so much
prettier than on TV.

379
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,333
Don't you think so, honey?
- Oh, I do.

380
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:32,876
- I mean, really.
- Oh!

381
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:35,045
- Oh.
- Are you OK, ma'am?

382
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,588
- Yes, thank you.
- I told her she's too old

383
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:38,715
for four-inch heels,
but you know how it is.

384
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,842
- Closer to God,
that's what I say.

385
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,345
- Amen.
- The devil is hiding,

386
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:46,723
<i>waiting to prey upon
lambs of our flock.</i>

387
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,391
<i>- Pastor Earle is a
master marketer...</i>

388
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:52,270
<i>I mean, publishing,
media network, merch.</i>

389
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,647
- Oh, they have
your favorite place.

390
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:54,856
- Oh.

391
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,316
- Yeah.

392
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,235
- You know how I
love the gift shops.

393
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:58,568
- Yeah, I know.

394
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:01,154
<i>- ♪ Lord,
I miss you, child ♪</i>

395
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,784
- Hey, Bird, you in yet?

396
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,577
<i>Birdie. Bird.</i>

397
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,663
- Keep your panties
on. I'm coming.

398
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,415
<i>- Despair not,

399
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,626
<i>- ♪ Hey, what's

00:22:16,254 --> 00:22:18,129

<i>♪ Hey, let's go mess and

405
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,806
- Charlie, you getting this?

406
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:31,810
<i>- There is not...
- Charlie?</i>

407
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,687
<i>- A more human...</i>

408
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,188
- Yup, I'm on it.

409
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,648
<i>- Than breathing.</i>

410
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:38,608
<i>- Attendance the last
few years has been flat,</i>

411
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,571
<i>but yet ILLUMIN-8's
profits are decidedly up.</i>

412
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:43,864
- Breathe deeply.

413
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,532
<i>- Average donation is 10 bucks.</i>

414
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,409
- And give deeply.

415
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,869
<i>- These guys
shouldn't be taking in</i>

416
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,453
<i>more than 35K a sermon.</i>

417
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,580
- You see?

418
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:53,123
This is why I'm a
lapsed Catholic.

419
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,209
- So obviously they're
laundering money.

420
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,794
Where from?
- Don't know.

421
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:01,172
- His teeth are whiter
than a Wilco concert.

422
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,883
- You loved that concert.

423
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:04,509
- With money in your pocket.

424
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,678
- OK.

425
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,264
What's the play?

426
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:12,183
- The space between his public
persona and private life.

427
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,768
<i>Every Wednesday,
he gets a package.</i>

428
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,731
<i>New week, new burner.</i>

429
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,192
<i>He tosses the old phone,
activates the new one.</i>

430
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,485
We get our hands
on that new phone,

431
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,695
we got the keys to the kingdom.

432
00:23:31,454 --> 00:23:33,121
He stole my purse!

433
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:35,415
That SOB stole my purse!

434
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,292
Oh.

435
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,169
- Oh, my God.

436
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,174
- You saved her.

437
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:46,259
- Oh, my gosh. Are you OK?

438
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,053
- Thank you.

439
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,721
Why, thank... oh!

440
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,973
Are you that pastor from TV?

441
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,945
- Are you OK?
- Easy, Karen.

442
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:06,321
Not everything's a viral moment.

443
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:08,448
- Who asked you? Mind
your own business.

444
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,866
- Oh, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

445
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,034
- Pastor.
- That's racist.

446
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,535
- That's not racist!

447
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,537
- You're a proper
hero is what you are.

448
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,997
- I have rights.
- Peace be with you.

449
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:16,958
- I can film anything I want to.

450
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,583
- Did someone drop a phone?

451
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,918
- Oh.

452
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,629
That's...

453
00:24:22,922 --> 00:24:24,381
Bless you.

454
00:24:24,382 --> 00:24:26,299
Thank you.

455
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,968
- Find anything?

456
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,469
- I did.

457
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,513
Whoever the pastor is
laundering money for,

458
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:33,974
he's meeting tonight
at some D. C. gala.

459
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:35,809
If these guys are taking
the risk to meet in person,

460
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,561
they're either celebrating,
or they're scared.

461
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,230
Either way, we can use that.

462
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:43,191
- Hey, you, like, cranked my
wrist on that purse snatch.

463
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:57,789
- Ferraris don't wait in line.

464
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,545
Invitation?

465
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,951
So the dirty cash goes in.

466
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,162
The church cleans it.

467
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:39,330
Then the pastor takes his
cut and donates the rest

468
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,249
around town to buy
access and influence

469
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,668
for whoever it is he's
taking orders from.

470
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,170
- One big D. C. shell game.

471
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:46,838
And they think we're the crooks.

472
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,964
- Huh.

473
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,132
- Hi.

474
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,009
- So even you can understand it.

475
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,052
I gave him the invitation.

476
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:53,970
He took my car.
- All right.

477
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,388
I'm on the pastor.
You find his contact.

478
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,598
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:31,758
- And it also helps
that he's my father.

480
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,888
- So, Emma, your father's
the former governor.

481
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,264
Your brother's a senator.

482
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,390
What does that make you?

483
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,476
- A crushing disappointment.

484
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,269
Oh!

485
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,440
- No, I'm actually
a data analyst

486
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,859
for a logistics firm.

487
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,486
- Oh, that's great.

488
00:26:57,535 --> 00:26:59,035
- A negroni.

489
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,620
Really?

490
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,710
How is it?

491
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:09,963
- Imperfect.
- Mm.

492
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,464
- No fire trick.

493
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,763
You're here.

494
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,390
- I'm here.

495
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:25,395
- Let me guess.

496
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:27,772
They needed a theremin
player for the band.

497
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,607
No.

498
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:34,279
Actually wanted some face
time with my congressman.

499
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,489
This pothole can't
seem to get fixed.

500
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:43,538
It's strange, seeing you in
something other than a robe.

501
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:45,415
- Was that a compliment?

502
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,668
- I can do better.

503
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,056
- You are an old sandbagger,

504
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:05,018
because I know what you're up...

505
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,519
- We'll see you inside.

506
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:09,898
May I pray with you, Pastor?

507
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:11,733
- Of course.

508
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:48,770
<i>- Break time.</i>

509
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,109
- What do you mean?

510
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,194
- What do you think I mean?

511
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:04,243
- So your family's...
impressive.

512
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,621
- Mm, only from the
outside looking in.

513
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:10,291
Spin over substance,
all day, every day.

514
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,752
- Mm.

515
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:17,340
I own a bar... with my
family in Baltimore.

516
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:21,928
Who I am is so wrapped up
in who they are that it's...

517
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,014
hard to see past it
sometimes, you know?

518
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:28,059
- I have the opposite problem.

519
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,313
Been defining myself
against them my entire life.

520
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:33,399
- Sounds lonely.

521
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:36,818
- It can be.

522
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,958
Sorry. I got to...

523
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,127
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

524
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:55,253
- Mm-hmm.

525
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,963
Yeah.

526
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,550
- Hey.

527
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,010
What in the hell are you doing?

528
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:04,178
- Just blending in.
- Please.

529
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,514
I am the one person who always
knows when you're lying.

530
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:10,309
- What's going on
with the pastor?

531
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,812
- Well, I identified his
contact, and you're right.

532
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,856
He's nervous, which means
that something's up,

533
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:18,401
which you would know if you
weren't otherwise distracted.

534
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:20,319
Charlie, this was your plan.

535
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,446
You brought me on board.

536
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:22,780
I am here.

537
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,158
Where are you?

538
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,993
Don't do this to me again.

539
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:38,337
- Hey, sorry about that.

540
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,881
I have to go.

541
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,716
Work thing.

542
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:44,719
But tomorrow night,

543
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,346
French-fusion place on Concord,

544
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:52,060
a harpist playing a song
neither of us knows.

545
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:53,770
- Sounds wonderful.

546
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,272
But...

547
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,982
I have a thing.

548
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,818
You have a thing?

549
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,282
What's going on? Did
something happen?

550
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:11,120
- It's like you said, Emma.

551
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,790
There's a big difference
between fantasy and reality.

552
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:19,796
- Can you honestly say
you didn't think about me,

553
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:21,672
that you don't think
there's something here?

554
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:27,178
- I didn't.

555
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,596
And I don't.

556
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:14,760
- Stop.

557
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,392
Did anyone follow you?

558
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:23,602
- No.

559
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:24,812
- Leave the suitcase.

560
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:27,147
We'll take it from here.

561
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:29,818
Our friend will be in
touch when he knows more.

562
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:33,195
Get going.

563
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:34,406
- Thank you.

564
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,871
- Don't let Tina
near that suitcase.

565
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,247
Hey, you know what?

566
00:32:43,248 --> 00:32:45,208
- Too soon.

567
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:48,460
- Wow.

568
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:50,087
Look at you.
- I was at a thing.

569
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:51,297
Talk to me.

570
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:53,465
- That signal in
the noise you found?

571
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:55,634
The deputy director ran it
past our friends at the FBI,

572
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:56,760
and guess what.

573
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:58,846
- We got a hit?

574
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,264
- Patrick Maguire.

575
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:02,766
This dude's basically the
Jeff Bezos of fentanyl.

576
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,351
His operations have
doubled in size

577
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:05,978
in the last three years.

578
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:07,688
Been on the FBI's
radar for a while,

579
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,356
but they couldn't nail him.

580
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:11,567
So we traced the
movements of his crew,

581
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:15,487
hacked into a nearby security
camera, and got this.

582
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,325
- Who's that?

583
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,160
- No clue.

584
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:23,746
But he stiffed the
syndicate on a deal, so...

585
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:25,080
Maguire's still here
trying to secure

586
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:26,749
an East Coast distribution hub.

587
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,168
- Call our friends at the FBI.

588
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:30,836
I want to be there when
this guy goes down.

589
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:32,338
- Done and done.

590
00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:36,008
<i>- ♪ You got it ♪</i>

591
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:37,551
- You guys should have seen
the look on the pastor's face.

592
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,345
I thought he was gonna
crap his holy trousers.

593
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:40,554
- Beautiful work, guys.

594
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:44,183
Just beautiful work.

595
00:33:44,184 --> 00:33:45,976
- Except for the part
where Charlie almost blew

596
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:48,062
the whole operation on
account of some girl.

597
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:49,855
<i>- ♪ I said ow ♪</i>

598
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:51,857
<i>♪ Ow, ow ♪</i>

599
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:53,317
- We'll have to be
smart about this,

600
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:55,486
launder a little at a
time through the bar.

601
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:58,113
At least you and Dad can
still start your retirement.

602
00:33:58,114 --> 00:33:59,698
- Yeah, for what it's
worth, I vote Mexico.

603
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,617
Spain's too far away.

604
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:04,119
- So... there's a
new girl, Charlie?

605
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,330
- Was, not is.

606
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:08,332
- Why was?

607
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,501
- 'Cause, Mom, like, this is
what I'm good at, all right?

608
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:11,752
Just this.

609
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:13,963
<i>- ♪ Do the Everything ♪</i>

610
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,012
- We're not OK with this.

611
00:34:22,013 --> 00:34:23,389
- With what?

612
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,391
- With your mother and I
sailing off into the sunset

613
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:28,394
while you stay here to fall
on your sword for this family.

614
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:29,979
You did that once.

615
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,314
- Dad, it's fine.
- Just stop!

616
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:37,987
It's our fault that
you went inside,

617
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:39,571
had to survive that hell.

618
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:43,492
We're in this spot today
because of our choices,

619
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:44,702
not yours.

620
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:46,495
- And you're right, Charlie.

621
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:48,831
You are the best.

622
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:50,332
The best.

623
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:53,961
But this can't be
your whole world.

624
00:34:53,962 --> 00:34:57,214
- I got a lifetime of regrets,

625
00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:59,675
and soon I may not
remember any of them.

626
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:06,515
So no, Charlie, no.

627
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:07,683
No, we're not walking away

628
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:09,893
and leaving you holding the bag.

629
00:35:09,894 --> 00:35:11,854
Either we're all
out, or we're all in.

630
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:19,653
- Mr. Maguire, we're
all set and ready to go.

631
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,447
All right.

632
00:35:21,448 --> 00:35:23,532
- I told you that
deal was rotten.

633
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:24,451
Should have listened to me.

634
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:27,954
Stop thinking you're
smarter than me.

635
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:31,207
It won't end well.

636
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:36,921
- I'll be right behind you.

637
00:35:51,478 --> 00:35:53,437
- We got movement.

638
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:55,356
On my count.
- Hold up.

639
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:57,649
We need to wait until his
whole crew is on the plane.

640
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,401
- You did your job.

641
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:01,278
Now let us do ours.

642
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:15,667
- Drop the bag!

643
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:18,045
Drop the bag!

644
00:36:18,046 --> 00:36:20,255
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

645
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:55,791
Damn it.

646
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,947
<i>- You good?</i>

647
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:02,365
<i>How's your wrist?</i>

648
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:04,868
<i>- It's fine. I'm fine.</i>

649
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,953
Did you get an ID on
our mystery woman?

650
00:37:06,954 --> 00:37:10,165
<i>- Yes. Daphne Finch.</i>

651
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,459
Grew up in Philadelphia
to a single mother,

652
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,086
law degree at Penn,
MBA at Columbia.

653
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:16,463
Maguire brought her
in a couple years ago

654
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:18,548
as a kind of consultant.

655
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:21,051
<i>- The crime
syndicate's consultant?</i>

656
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:22,469
- Weird, right?

657
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,263
<i>Nothing about this girl
screams Irish gangster.</i>

658
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:27,724
- It's her.

659
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:30,935
She's the reason their
operation expanded so quickly.

660
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:33,355
She's the brains behind
Maguire's syndicate,

661
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:36,316
which means arresting
Maguire changes nothing.

662
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:38,401
<i>Pull all available data:</i>

663
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:41,488
<i>phone records, emails, texts,
and every known associate.</i>

664
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:45,658
<i>- So we won the battle?</i>

665
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:47,327
- Yeah...

666
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:49,079
but not the war.

667
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:58,963
I got to call you back.

668
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:17,023
- What happened? Are you...

669
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:18,608
- I'm fine.

670
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:19,609
What are you doing here?

671
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:23,780
- Look, about last
night, I want to explain.

672
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:25,281
- It's really not necessary.

673
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:26,575
- No, it is. Look.

674
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,036
My life,

675
00:38:30,037 --> 00:38:31,664
my family, it's...

676
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:36,209
It's complicated.

677
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,462
The more you know about me,
the faster you'll want to run.

678
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:40,755
I get it.

679
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:43,383
We spent 36 hours
in a hotel room.

680
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:45,635
We barely know each other.
Let's just leave it at that.

681
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:47,178
- You're wrong.
I do know you.

682
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,975
<i>Coffee, black.</i>

683
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:55,186
<i>Stones over the Beatles,
all day, every day.</i>

684
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:59,107
<i>You read people better
than they read themselves.</i>

685
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:02,110
<i>You're loyal,</i>

686
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,903
<i>but you don't trust easily</i>

687
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:05,780
<i>or often.</i>

688
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,617
<i>And you're funny,
even though you use it</i>

689
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:11,286
<i>to protect yourself.</i>

690
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:16,207
<i>I know you want
something different.</i>

691
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,876
<i>So do I.</i>

692
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:21,212
I want to take you on that date.

693
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,298
What do you say?

694
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:25,341
- I say you're right.

695
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:28,261
I don't trust easily or
often, but last night...

696
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:31,890
- Last night, I lied

697
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,850
when I said that...

698
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,811
there wasn't
something between us,

699
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:40,356
when I said I didn't
think about you.

700
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:44,444
Truth is, I never stopped
thinking about you,

701
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:47,614
not once, not for a minute.

702
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:50,742
I...

703
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:52,327
Emma.

704
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:11,930
- Maybe we just stay here,

705
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:13,640
do this.

706
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:16,643
- For how long?

707
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:21,272
- Indefinitely.

708
00:40:21,273 --> 00:40:22,815
- Yeah.

709
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,539
Hey, Bird.

710
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,958
Forget everything I
said last night, OK?

711
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,876
We're not gonna chip
away at the debt.

712
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:43,294
That's not how
this is gonna work.

713
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:45,630
One last big score gets
us all out for good.

714
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:47,966
- Yeah, I've heard that before.

715
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,247
- Hey, it's different this time.

716
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,261
- OK.

717
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:55,139
- Charlie.

718
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:01,854
- Oh, great.

719
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:03,022
Looks like we got the
whole family here.

720
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:04,232
- Ollie?
- Wait, no, hold on, Bird.

721
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:07,193
Wait. Just wait.

722
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,991
- You won.

723
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:16,494
Smart kid.

724
00:41:16,495 --> 00:41:17,704
Wonder where she gets it.

725
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,501
This is a nice place, Charlie.

726
00:41:24,753 --> 00:41:25,920
- Look, about your money...

727
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:28,423
- It's gone. I heard.

728
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:30,258
Love can be a real bitch, huh?

729
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,387
- You owe us the 10
million you stole

730
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:35,930
plus an additional 5.

731
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:37,307
Let's call it the cost

732
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:39,142
of getting Mr. Maguire
out of prison.

733
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:40,977
- Why?

734
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,186
I mean, it looks like
you got what you wanted.

735
00:41:42,187 --> 00:41:43,646
You're in charge.

736
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:44,398
I'm glad I could help
you out with that.

737
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,649
- Careful, Charlie.

738
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,193
There is no angle out of this

739
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:52,739
except for you doing
exactly what I tell you to.

740
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:02,832
- OK.

741
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,876
So what guarantee do I have
that you're not just gonna

742
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:08,046
take your money,
then... take care of us?

743
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,131
- That's the problem
with lying for a living.

744
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:12,967
You never really know who
you can trust, do you?

745
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:21,351
- Look, that kind of money,
it's gonna take me some time.

746
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:22,977
- Which I don't have.

747
00:42:22,978 --> 00:42:26,815
So I suggest you do
what you do best.

748
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:30,360
Get to stealing, Charlie,

749
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:31,861
because you are
not gonna be able
