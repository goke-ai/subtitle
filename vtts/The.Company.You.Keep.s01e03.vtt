Previously on
"The Company You Keep"...


2
00:00:02.582 --> 00:00:03.939
Do you want to get out of here?

3
00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:05.140
Absolutely.

4
00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:08.849
U.S. Senate, huh?

5
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:11.268
Yeah, he's running
for my dad's old seat.


6
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.418
You owe us
the 10 million you stole


7
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.104
plus an additional 5.

8
00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:17.102
- Is that...
- The bug we planted.


9
00:00:17.103 --> 00:00:18.521
We have a minute to give?

10
00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:19.819
Don't worry about it.

11
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.228
It's early stage memory loss.
That's it.


12
00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.762
I'm not getting myself
or my family picked up


13
00:00:23.764 --> 00:00:26.053
just to make good
on your payment schedule.


14
00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:29.319
Try explaining that to
Patrick Maguire's son Connor,


15
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.657
the guy whose father is
now locked up, thanks to you.


16
00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:33.446
Now do you believe
I have what it takes


17
00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:35.114
to run this organization?

18
00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:36.323
She's his daughter.

19
00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:39.371
Daphne is
Patrick McGuire's daughter.


20
00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.299
- Oh!
- No, I'm not going up!


21
00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:49.550
Oh!

22
00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:54.754
Man, how are you going to
let me keep draining


23
00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.463
that one on you like that, huh?

24
00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:58.091
You seem good,
all things considered.


25
00:00:58.092 --> 00:00:59.879

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:09.010
Yeah.
You're up.


31
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:10.299

32
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.547

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:12.747

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:16.294

How do you always manage
to keep it old-school, huh?


38
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.751
What's she like?

39
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.710
Ah, she's smart...

Beautiful, funny,

I mean, my dad's starting
to slip a little bit.


43
00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.876
That sounds brutal.

44
00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:44.954

00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:13.996
why are you lying

Hey, do all your guests
go out the back door,


61
00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:47.871
or am I special?

62
00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:49.419
I live next to my sister
and niece


63
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.667
above the bar
that I own with my family.


64
00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:53.415
So you're more than welcome
to go out the front door


65
00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:54.794
and bump into them
in the hallway.


66
00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:55.994
Hmm.

67
00:02:57.912 --> 00:02:58.711
Hmm?

68
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.710
Hmm.

69
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:01.249
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.


70
00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.537
You must be Ollie.

71
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.837
Is Emma.

72
00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:28.611
Uh...

73
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.998
OK, I think.

74
00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:48.002
- Hey.
- Hey.


75
00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:55.244
Ho ho, Simon.

76
00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:56.952
Yeah, he started
calling last week.


77
00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:58.620
I don't know why.
I don't need to know why.


78
00:03:58.621 --> 00:03:59.919
You can decline.

79
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.417
At least he's trying.

80
00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:03.036
Yeah. He is.

81
00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:05.873
Ten years of parent/teacher
conferences short of trying.


82
00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:08.001
But I was thinking about Daphne.

83
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:09.619
- Changing subjects?
- Yeah.


84
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.747
If she's Maguire's daughter,

85
00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:13.375
why is she slumming it with us?

86
00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:14.994
I don't know,
but we gotta figure out


87
00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:16.254
what princess is up to.

88
00:04:25.794 --> 00:04:27.213
It's just...

89
00:04:31.578 --> 00:04:32.877
Emma?

90
00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:36.832
I haven't changed
my sheets since Tina left.


91
00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:38.460
You have a new girlfriend?

92
00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:39.829
What do you know about her?

93
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.957
I know that I like her.

94
00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.939
Is that really
enough after Tina?


95
00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.245
Sorry.

96
00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:01.329
- All right?
- Oh, yeah?


97
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:02.530
Protect who from what?

98
00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:09.170
Oh, that was fast.

99
00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:10.878
That's what I said.

100
00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.097
So...

101
00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:20.748
Opens at 8:00,
so let's get going.


102
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.376
- Sorry.
- OK.


103
00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:23.576
No you're not.

104
00:05:42.038 --> 00:05:43.745
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.


105
00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:46.752
Hey, Bird, I got it.

106
00:05:46.753 --> 00:05:48.370
Just gonna go get some
details from Jones.


107
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:49.959
Won't be gone very long.

108
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.959
For what it's worth,
I don't love getting


109
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.586
into bed with Jones Malone.

110
00:05:52.587 --> 00:05:54.544
Oh, I never liked that guy.

111
00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:56.872
Even when you guys were
kids, big Gemini energy.


112
00:05:56.873 --> 00:05:59.080
Look, I don't like the guy
either, but unless one of you


113
00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:01.958
has a better play on the table?

114
00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:06.124
OK. I gotta go see a guy
about a horse.


115
00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.165
- Hello.
- I think I might've


116
00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:34.664
blown your plan
to keep me a secret.


117
00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:36.412
Yeah, so I hear.

118
00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:39.329
The good news is,
you got Ollie's approval.


119
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.128
The bad news?

120
00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.165
Now you gotta
meet the rest of them,


121
00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:45.203
win them all over.

122
00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.791
They want you to stop by
our Derby crab feast


123
00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:49.709
tomorrow night... just, you know,

124
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.456
family,
a couple of dozen regulars...


125
00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:53.875
No pressure.

126
00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:56.582
No, none at all.

127
00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.579
Hey, if this is too much,
you know, too fast...


128
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.496
No, no, it's, um...

129
00:07:02.497 --> 00:07:04.874
it's just the right speed.

130
00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:06.912
I'd love to meet your family.

131
00:07:06.913 --> 00:07:08.370
OK, great.

132
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:10.248
- It's a... it's a date.
- See ya.


133
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:12.087
I gotta go
clean ten more stalls,


134
00:07:12.088 --> 00:07:13.625
but it was nice
meeting you, Frank.


135
00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:15.833
- Thank you.
- Frank, huh?


136
00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:17.622
It is today.

137
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.707
You showed up.

138
00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:24.204
Does this mean you're in?

139
00:07:24.205 --> 00:07:25.663
Tell me about the job.

140
00:07:25.664 --> 00:07:27.461
It's right up your alley.

141
00:07:27.462 --> 00:07:30.168
I'm selling a horse I
don't own to a mark so rich


142
00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:31.827
he won't even miss the money.

143
00:07:31.828 --> 00:07:34.794
Then... I disappear.

144
00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:37.501
So how are you
handling the real owners?


145
00:07:37.502 --> 00:07:39.459
Stable hand just confirmed
they're out of the country


146
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.667
and won't be here
for the big race.


147
00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:43.915
What's the money looking like?

148
00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:46.502
I've primed her to buy
the horse for a million.


149
00:07:46.503 --> 00:07:48.500
I've done most of the work.
Your cut would be 15.


150
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.248
That's a little light, Jonesy.

151
00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:53.205
Come on, a generous cut
will be 20 to bring it home.


152
00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.375
Better.

153
00:07:54.376 --> 00:07:56.003
Who's the target?

154
00:07:56.004 --> 00:07:58.330
Martha Pope.

155
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:01.917
She's a venture capitalist with
space travel kind of money.


156
00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:04.584
It's a sweet deal.
What do you say?


157
00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:05.784
Frankie.

158
00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:08.870
There she is now.

159
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:10.919
Were your ears burning, baby?

160
00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:16.122
Can you believe
this beautiful woman


161
00:08:16.123 --> 00:08:18.250
- is going to be my wife?
- Oh, stop it.


162
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:19.709
This is that
legendary horse trainer


163
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.629
I was telling you all about.

164
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.336
Ah.

165
00:08:22.337 --> 00:08:23.536
Pleasure.
Martha Pope.


166
00:08:25.244 --> 00:08:26.542
Buck Calhoun.

167
00:08:26.543 --> 00:08:28.501
Pleasure's all mine, ma'am.

168
00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:32.666
Hey, how was the concert?

169
00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:33.746
Well, I remember the first half.

170
00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:36.372
- Been there.
- Mm.


171
00:08:36.373 --> 00:08:38.500
Ooh, relationship status form.

172
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:39.500
Yes.

173
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.707
I'm filling out the E99.

174
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.626
I'm not going to overthink this.

175
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.709
Bug.

176
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.724
Hilarious.

177
00:08:51.726 --> 00:08:55.642
Daphne Finch is surprisingly
sassy for a mob lawyer.


178
00:08:55.644 --> 00:08:58.180
Really gave it her all to
make us look like idiots.


179
00:08:58.181 --> 00:08:59.639
Yeah.

180
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.056
Why put on such a big show

181
00:09:02.057 --> 00:09:04.805
when she's just pulling
up stakes and leaving town?


182
00:09:06.603 --> 00:09:08.561
She's trying to get
us off her tail.


183
00:09:11.228 --> 00:09:14.894
Martha Pope founded
her first company at 14,


184
00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:18.561
dropped out of college,
six figures by 21.


185
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.596
She's donated millions
to renewable energy.


186
00:09:22.597 --> 00:09:24.764
Can't believe
that slippery weasel


187
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:27.391
got this woman
to agree to marry him.


188
00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:30.268
Hey, Charlie, Martha Pope
sounds like a saint.


189
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.977
But cooler.

190
00:09:31.978 --> 00:09:34.264
Yeah, the vibe on this
one is bad, Charlie.


191
00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:36.262
This isn't our kind of job, son.

192
00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:37.811
I agree.

193
00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:39.179
That's why we're not
going after Martha.


194
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.268
We're gonna take down
the con man.


195
00:09:49.206 --> 00:09:50.717
There she is.

196
00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:52.958
Wow.

197
00:09:55.154 --> 00:09:57.742
So that's what a million
dollar horse looks like.


198
00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:00.948
Kinda looks like
every other horse I've seen,


199
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:02.108
- to be honest.
- Oh, but she isn't.


200
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.597
How are you?
Good to see you.


201
00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:04.729
Hi.

202
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:06.438
No, she's that
rare breed of female


203
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.517
that dominates the males
at the highest level...


204
00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:11.188
Maybe something you might
know a little bit about.


205
00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:14.364
I'd tell you that she
had a sweet temperament,


206
00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:16.242
but I'd be lying.

207
00:10:16.243 --> 00:10:17.701
Well, I'll take winning
over sweet any day.


208
00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:19.739
Now you're talking her language.

209
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.935
Dad, are you sure about this?

210
00:10:21.937 --> 00:10:23.275
Yeah.

211
00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:25.404
So why are you selling?

212
00:10:26.363 --> 00:10:28.071
She was my wife's horse.

213
00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:30.778
It's time.

214
00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:34.404
I'm so sorry for your loss.

215
00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:38.190
Oh, yeah, his wife
was a wonderful woman,


216
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:40.937
beautiful inside and out.

217
00:10:40.938 --> 00:10:43.735
She looks nice,
but what's under the hood?


218
00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:45.313
Oh, that's even
better than she looks.


219
00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:47.611
Here, I brought these...
Her medical records.


220
00:10:47.612 --> 00:10:51.647
So tell me, how long
have you two been together?


221
00:10:51.648 --> 00:10:55.153
Just a couple of months,
which is crazy, I know.


222
00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:58.770
It's been such a whirlwind.

223
00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:02.066
But honestly, I can't
remember my life before Frank.


224
00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:05.773
She's more impressive
in person, just like you.


225
00:11:05.774 --> 00:11:07.022
Aw.

226
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.099
Mm.

227
00:11:17.312 --> 00:11:19.229
Let's buy a horse.

228
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.728
Ha!

229
00:11:20.729 --> 00:11:22.106
You made a very smart buy.

230
00:11:22.107 --> 00:11:23.395
Thanks.

231
00:11:23.396 --> 00:11:24.734
I'll need to see the contract.

232
00:11:24.735 --> 00:11:26.312
- Yes, of course.
- I have an idea.


233
00:11:26.313 --> 00:11:28.820
How about you gentlemen
handle the busywork


234
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:31.212
for a change, and we'll, uh,
we'll celebrate.


235
00:11:31.214 --> 00:11:32.882
Hmm?
Champagne on me.


236
00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:37.102
Yeah...

237
00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:38.910
Be good.

238
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:52.776
The same bad policies on crime,

239
00:11:52.777 --> 00:11:54.814
the same failed
health care reform,


240
00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:56.812
the same tax hikes.

241
00:11:56.813 --> 00:11:59.189
You deserve better
than more of the same.


242
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.445
David Hill...
A legacy of failure.


243
00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:05.273
When they go low, we go high.

244
00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:07.061
Thanks, Michelle.

245
00:12:07.062 --> 00:12:08.151
It's still good advice.

246
00:12:08.152 --> 00:12:09.819
It's a good slogan.

247
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.817
Good advice is, they go low,
we raise money.


248
00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:14.064
You, start rolling calls.

249
00:12:14.065 --> 00:12:15.733
- You...
- I know, I know.


250
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.732
Save the Chesapeake
charity brunch.


251
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.397
She's right about the calls.

252
00:12:21.398 --> 00:12:23.356
We need money to
spread the message.


253
00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.359
Hey, question.

254
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.987
So who's the guy?

255
00:12:30.988 --> 00:12:32.985
I don't know what
you're talking about.


256
00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:34.654
I mean, you've hardly
been home all week,


257
00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:36.811
and you're doing way
too much smiling.


258
00:12:36.812 --> 00:12:39.818
For a spy, you're not very
good at keeping secrets.


259
00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.357
So who is he?

260
00:12:41.358 --> 00:12:43.566
You don't have that clearance.

261
00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:46.443
Can I get a coffee black?

262
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:49.569
This one's on me.

263
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.437
What's that I smell?
An agenda?


264
00:12:54.605 --> 00:12:56.732
Come on, sing.
We both know the script.


265
00:12:56.733 --> 00:12:58.570
Our agencies
don't play well together.


266
00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:00.857
The feds shoot first,
ask questions later.


267
00:13:00.858 --> 00:13:02.146
We ask questions first...

268
00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:04.194
Then just keep asking questions.

269
00:13:04.195 --> 00:13:07.441
$1,000 a kilo?

270
00:13:07.442 --> 00:13:09.189
What's the catch?

271
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.608
No catch.

272
00:13:10.609 --> 00:13:11.936
You go walk right out that door

273
00:13:11.937 --> 00:13:13.774
and sell it for five times that?

274
00:13:13.775 --> 00:13:15.852
Why give that kind of
advantage to your competition?


275
00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:17.860
We want the same thing.

276
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:19.858
Get these drugs off the street.

277
00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:23.025
And arresting Maguire hasn't
changed that flow any has it?


278
00:13:23.026 --> 00:13:24.773
Because I'm looking
to build partnerships


279
00:13:24.774 --> 00:13:27.401
with proven professionals.

280
00:13:27.402 --> 00:13:29.189
You didn't hear it from me,
et cetera, et cetera.


281
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.647
But the streets are flooded.

282
00:13:31.648 --> 00:13:34.064
Everybody is selling
Fenty at a discount.


283
00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:35.653
Losing money doesn't
sound like something


284
00:13:35.654 --> 00:13:37.441
the Maguires would do.

285
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:38.979
I know.

286
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.897
It's hard to believe,
but maybe you're wrong.


287
00:13:40.898 --> 00:13:43.485
Maybe arresting Papa Maguire
scared them off.


288
00:13:43.486 --> 00:13:45.942
Now they're dumping their stock.

289
00:13:45.943 --> 00:13:49.189
Next time we get a shipment
and you don't like the price,


290
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.898
you buy from someone else.

291
00:13:56.613 --> 00:13:58.440
You know, I'd actually
given up on marriage,


292
00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:00.228
and then I met Frank.

293
00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:04.104
He was the first man
who wasn't intimidated by me.


294
00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:05.733
We got engaged
three weeks later.


295
00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:08.729
Sounds like he
really makes you happy.


296
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.319
He does.
He really does.


297
00:14:11.528 --> 00:14:13.395
So I have something to tell you,

298
00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:16.403
and I'm going to need you
not to go try and kill him.


299
00:14:17.612 --> 00:14:19.280
Your fiancé's a con artist.

300
00:14:21.438 --> 00:14:23.395
His name's not Frank.
It's Jones Malone.


301
00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:24.903
We grew up together,

302
00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:28.820
and he has hired us
to fleece you for your money.


303
00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:33.195
That's not possible.

304
00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:35.443
Let me take a wild guess.

305
00:14:35.444 --> 00:14:37.061
A chance bump in
where you both had


306
00:14:37.062 --> 00:14:39.818
- the same unique coffee order?
- OK.


307
00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:41.986
Sparkling conversation with
the same unusual interests?


308
00:14:41.987 --> 00:14:45.273
And then you don't see him
for three weeks...


309
00:14:45.274 --> 00:14:47.441
Enough time to have
a couple of boring dates


310
00:14:47.442 --> 00:14:49.439
so that you're so excited
to see him again


311
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.695
that it prompts you
to ask him out.


312
00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:55.902
And then a spontaneous engagement

313
00:14:55.903 --> 00:14:57.860
with his mother's ring,

314
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:59.688
a mother that he never met,

315
00:14:59.689 --> 00:15:01.897
because tragically,
she died in childbirth.


316
00:15:03.985 --> 00:15:06.901
He has run a version of
this since high school.


317
00:15:06.902 --> 00:15:10.858
He will do this,
and then he will disappear.


318
00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:17.561
Well, Birdie's
certainly taking her time.


319
00:15:17.562 --> 00:15:19.609
Can't rush a mark, Jonesy.

320
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.856
OK, here we go.

321
00:15:21.857 --> 00:15:24.604
I'm not signing anything.
This is a scam.


322
00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:26.062
What?

323
00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:28.270
I may not know horses,

324
00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:31.488
but I can spot unfounded hype
before an IPO.


325
00:15:33.606 --> 00:15:37.191
So I get revenge,
and you get what exactly?


326
00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:38.650
His money.

327
00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:41.437
Seems fair.

328
00:15:41.438 --> 00:15:45.443
We start by using
the truth to sell a lie.


329
00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:47.730
The best way to
test a product's worth


330
00:15:47.731 --> 00:15:49.149
is public valuation.

331
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.817
Yeah.
What do they call that?


332
00:15:50.818 --> 00:15:52.276
- Crowd, crowd...
- Crowdsourcing.


333
00:15:52.277 --> 00:15:54.104
Crowdsourcing, yeah.

334
00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:56.442
Tie the sale price of
the horse to the closing odds


335
00:15:56.443 --> 00:15:57.611
before the race.

336
00:15:57.612 --> 00:15:59.569
It's unorthodox,
that's for sure.


337
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.437
- I know.
- I love unorthodox.


338
00:16:01.438 --> 00:16:03.445
Once we have the new terms,

339
00:16:03.446 --> 00:16:04.983
you're going to name your price.

340
00:16:04.984 --> 00:16:08.190
Listen, the current odds
on Wicked Swift are 10 to 1.


341
00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:12.066
Numbers remain the same, price
remains the same... $1 million.


342
00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:13.604
OK, but what if they change?

343
00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.483
Every point's worth
a quarter million.


344
00:16:15.484 --> 00:16:18.729
So if the odds get worse, we
sell for less than a million?


345
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.107
But if the odds get better,
boss, you'd be making more.


346
00:16:23.605 --> 00:16:24.853
97 to 1.

347
00:16:24.854 --> 00:16:27.610
That's... almost 2 million.

348
00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:30.188
He will be spending
your money in his head,


349
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.487
thrilled at the prospect

350
00:16:31.488 --> 00:16:33.355
of getting even more
than he anticipated.


351
00:16:33.356 --> 00:16:35.103
That's where we prime
him to put his money in.


352
00:16:35.104 --> 00:16:36.482
You're a natural.

353
00:16:36.483 --> 00:16:38.360
My cap is 2 million.

354
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:40.279
Odds get better than

355
00:16:41.897 --> 00:16:43.026
Works for me.

356
00:16:43.027 --> 00:16:44.404
Once you've hooked him,

357
00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:46.403
leave it to us
to handle the odds.


358
00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:49.399
Do you really
think we can do this?


359
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.237
Con men are the easiest
marks of all,


360
00:16:51.238 --> 00:16:53.355
because they never think
it can happen.


361
00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:56.691
And with an ego like Jones's,
he will never see it coming.


362
00:16:56.692 --> 00:16:58.401
I'm all in.

363
00:17:16.413 --> 00:17:18.160
Connor!

364
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:20.657
I've got her.

365
00:17:20.658 --> 00:17:22.406
What the hell's
going on over there?


366
00:17:22.407 --> 00:17:24.863
Good morning to you too, Connor.

367
00:17:24.864 --> 00:17:26.684
Your calling is for sure.

368
00:17:26.686 --> 00:17:29.369
Where's my money?

369
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.447
White people don't like
drugs no more, is that it?


370
00:17:31.448 --> 00:17:32.905
Well, circumstances have changed

371
00:17:32.906 --> 00:17:34.494
since your little fiasco

372
00:17:34.495 --> 00:17:36.322
alerted the feds to our presence

373
00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:37.820
and left me without a warehouse.

374
00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:40.238
- You were there.
- It was your deal.


375
00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:41.786
But don't worry,
I figured out a way


376
00:17:41.787 --> 00:17:43.365
to keep the expansion
plan on schedule


377
00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:45.912
without putting
another Maguire behind bars.


378
00:17:45.913 --> 00:17:47.201
Go on then, I'm listening.

379
00:17:47.202 --> 00:17:49.449
You handle your end.
I will handle mine.


380
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.496
- Your father trusts me.
- So should you.


381
00:17:51.497 --> 00:17:54.953
Trust is for family,
not lawyers.


382
00:17:54.954 --> 00:17:56.912
Make the money right.

383
00:17:57.781 --> 00:17:59.829
Or do I have to come over?

384
00:18:00.988 --> 00:18:03.575
The money will be right.

385
00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:09.029
I assure you, I am no
carbon copy of my father.


386
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.868
I actually disagree
with him on some policy...


387
00:18:11.947 --> 00:18:13.494
- Hey there.
- Not interested.


388
00:18:13.495 --> 00:18:14.953
- A vote for David Hill...
- The mailbox is full.


389
00:18:14.954 --> 00:18:16.571
David Hill here.

390
00:18:16.572 --> 00:18:18.131
- Um, no thank you.
- I will disagree...


391
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.077
A vote for David Hill...

392
00:18:21.078 --> 00:18:23.365
A vote for David Hill
isn't a vote for the past,


393
00:18:23.366 --> 00:18:24.863
but for your future.

394
00:18:24.864 --> 00:18:25.953
For your future.

395
00:18:25.954 --> 00:18:27.531
Sorry, but no.

396
00:18:30.738 --> 00:18:33.155
You're clearly off to
a better night than me.


397
00:18:33.156 --> 00:18:34.863
Is this a good
meet-the-parents dress?


398
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.451
Our parents or normal parents?

399
00:18:36.452 --> 00:18:39.528
Are you saying our
parents aren't normal?


400
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:41.157
Don't sweat mystery
boyfriend's parents.


401
00:18:41.158 --> 00:18:42.157
You'll be great.

402
00:18:42.158 --> 00:18:43.534
Thanks.

403
00:18:43.535 --> 00:18:45.203
Back to the grindstone for me.

404
00:18:45.204 --> 00:18:46.492
You'll be great too.

405
00:18:55.114 --> 00:18:56.113
Hey there.

406
00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:57.700
David Hill here.

407
00:18:57.701 --> 00:18:59.329
Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking with?


408
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.367
How are your damage
control calls going?


409
00:19:01.368 --> 00:19:03.245
I wouldn't say damage control.

410
00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:05.862
I'd say opportunities
to get to know my...


411
00:19:05.863 --> 00:19:08.030
David, this is Claire Fox.

412
00:19:08.031 --> 00:19:10.158
I assume you know who I am.

413
00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:13.205
There's no easy way to say this,

414
00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:15.822
but at this very moment,
the party's discussing


415
00:19:15.823 --> 00:19:18.240
whether or not they should
pull their support,


416
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.238
focus on closer races...

417
00:19:20.239 --> 00:19:24.074
a devastating career blow for
the son of a beloved senator.


418
00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:25.452
David, I want to help you.

419
00:19:25.453 --> 00:19:27.282
I can ensure
their continued support.


420
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.238
I just texted
your personal cell.


421
00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:34.744
- We should talk.
- I'm not who you think I am.


422
00:19:41.497 --> 00:19:44.574
OK, the bar has officially
never been this clean.


423
00:19:45.453 --> 00:19:47.072
Nerves much?

424
00:19:48.201 --> 00:19:51.287
We're not exactly a normal
family, Mom, so I just...


425
00:19:51.288 --> 00:19:52.696
I want it to go well.

426
00:19:53.995 --> 00:19:55.114
Don't worry.

427
00:19:55.115 --> 00:19:56.952
We'll be on our best behavior.

428
00:20:14.035 --> 00:20:15.532
Hello again.

429
00:20:15.533 --> 00:20:16.872
She likes your purse.

430
00:20:24.914 --> 00:20:26.951
So what's the status
of the horse job?


431
00:20:26.952 --> 00:20:29.528
You said I'd see my
next payment by Monday.


432
00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:31.326
What's the rush?
It's Saturday.


433
00:20:31.327 --> 00:20:32.496
The money's coming.

434
00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.114
Is it?

435
00:20:34.115 --> 00:20:35.702
If you disapprove of my methods,

436
00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:38.240
maybe you'd prefer Connor's.

437
00:20:38.241 --> 00:20:40.078
- Should we give him a call?
- You know what?


438
00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.616
You wanna give him a call?
That's cool.


439
00:20:41.617 --> 00:20:44.034
Keep everybody honest
with their payment plan.


440
00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.622
You want to use
my phone or yours?


441
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.786
You just keep
delivering every week.


442
00:20:51.787 --> 00:20:53.455
I'll keep Connor at bay.

443
00:20:54.404 --> 00:20:56.282
OK.
Thanks.


444
00:20:56.283 --> 00:20:57.911
OK.

445
00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:04.704
Hey, everything OK?

446
00:21:06.492 --> 00:21:07.661
Yeah.

447
00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:09.119
That was interesting.

448
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.157
Daphne just threatened
to phone Connor


449
00:21:11.158 --> 00:21:13.494
when I called her on her bluff.

450
00:21:13.495 --> 00:21:15.612
Flash of panic.

451
00:21:15.613 --> 00:21:17.031
What do you wanna do with that?

452
00:21:17.032 --> 00:21:18.329
I don't know.
I'll tell you what.


453
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.908
I don't like the
fact that she thinks


454
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:21.496
she can just roll in here
any time she wants


455
00:21:21.497 --> 00:21:23.115
like she owns the place.

456
00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.573
Was I supposed to
use the fire escape?


457
00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:26.661
Hey, no.
Oh, my God.


458
00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:29.119
No, sorry.
No, not at all.


459
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.787
- I was just... my...
- Hey.


460
00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:32.535
You must be Emma.

461
00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:34.323
- This is my mom.
- Hi.


462
00:21:34.324 --> 00:21:35.862
Fran.
Nice to meet you.


463
00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:37.241
- Nice to meet you too.
- These are cool.


464
00:21:37.242 --> 00:21:38.489
Thank you.

465
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.198
Pearl's my birthstone.

466
00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:41.407
Gemini?

467
00:21:42.286 --> 00:21:44.034
But Virgo rising.

468
00:21:44.035 --> 00:21:45.662
Oh, OK.

469
00:21:45.663 --> 00:21:46.871
We're going to get
along just fine.


470
00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:48.200
Great.

471
00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:49.659
Come on in.

472
00:21:54.205 --> 00:21:57.820
That is a bold move,
going straight to the jukebox.


473
00:21:57.821 --> 00:22:00.407
I should tell you,
your entire reputation


474
00:22:00.408 --> 00:22:02.285
hinges on whatever it is
you're about to choose


475
00:22:02.286 --> 00:22:04.704
with these folks.

476
00:22:08.031 --> 00:22:09.909
Not worried.

477
00:22:13.745 --> 00:22:16.112
B12... good choice.

478
00:22:16.113 --> 00:22:19.698
Good choice.

479
00:22:22.286 --> 00:22:24.154
Grub's up, y'all.

480
00:22:24.155 --> 00:22:26.112
Mm, it smells amazing.

481
00:22:26.113 --> 00:22:27.911
Yep, it is.

482
00:22:30.448 --> 00:22:32.945
Hey, don't think
anything of it, OK?


483
00:22:32.946 --> 00:22:35.073
Birdie just tends to
keep her guard up.


484
00:22:35.074 --> 00:22:36.491
Oh, I wouldn't know
anything about that.


485
00:22:36.492 --> 00:22:38.909
- Oh, no?
- No, nothing.


486
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.118
- See that?
- OK.


487
00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:41.287
Beautiful.

488
00:22:41.288 --> 00:22:44.074
Now, you gotta separate...

489
00:22:44.075 --> 00:22:45.952
Hey, Ma, tell Charlie
to put his bib on.


490
00:22:45.953 --> 00:22:47.660
- Why?
- Put his bib on.


491
00:22:47.661 --> 00:22:49.698
Come sit.
You should...


492
00:22:49.699 --> 00:22:51.696
Here we go. Ready?
Gotta take this...


493
00:22:51.697 --> 00:22:52.866
I mean, this was
at the horse track.


494
00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:53.655
This was back when we were kids.

495
00:22:53.655 --> 00:22:54.654
We were like what?
Nine or ten?


496
00:22:54.655 --> 00:22:56.072
Ten years old or something.

497
00:22:56.073 --> 00:22:59.578
I thought I was so
good at picking horses.


498
00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:01.196
Turns out my father...

499
00:23:01.197 --> 00:23:03.324
He was changing all my
bet slips at the window.


500
00:23:03.325 --> 00:23:04.863
It took him three years.

501
00:23:04.864 --> 00:23:06.162
It took me three years
to figure out


502
00:23:06.163 --> 00:23:07.162
that I was no good at this.

503
00:23:07.162 --> 00:23:08.829
I was horrible.

504
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.237
Hey, I know how to pick winners.

505
00:23:10.238 --> 00:23:12.785
And I'm so sorry, my son, that
I did not pass that on to you.


506
00:23:12.786 --> 00:23:14.613
That's OK, Pop.

507
00:23:14.614 --> 00:23:16.281
Hey, could you grab me
another couple lagers, please?


508
00:23:16.282 --> 00:23:18.739
Two lagers, yeah.

509
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.577
You were always
good at it, though.


510
00:23:20.578 --> 00:23:22.496
Ah, I was all right.

511
00:23:25.993 --> 00:23:27.621
Here.

512
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.328
Way too many for one to carry.

513
00:23:34.364 --> 00:23:37.072
Turns out my son does
know how to pick a winner.


514
00:23:46.912 --> 00:23:50.907
Impressive. Much better
than the morning after...


515
00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:52.495
Whoa!

516
00:23:52.496 --> 00:23:54.324
Whoa, hey!

517
00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:58.410
Excuse me, Ollie.

518
00:24:05.533 --> 00:24:07.450
You said she was great.

519
00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:10.488
You didn't say she was great.

520
00:24:12.786 --> 00:24:15.242
Just heard from an asset
that a tall, very attractive


521
00:24:15.243 --> 00:24:17.200
American woman has been
having sit-downs


522
00:24:17.201 --> 00:24:20.197
with several
of Maguire's local rivals.


523
00:24:20.198 --> 00:24:22.785
Maybe she's trying to get out
of the drug game after all.


524
00:24:22.786 --> 00:24:24.533
If she were just
offloading product,


525
00:24:24.534 --> 00:24:27.160
she wouldn't need to
go to multiple rivals.


526
00:24:27.161 --> 00:24:31.196
It must be some kind of
play, but to what end?


527
00:24:31.197 --> 00:24:32.945
So how's it going over there?

528
00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:34.913
More of a "Meet the Parents"

529
00:24:34.914 --> 00:24:36.821
or a "Meet the Fockers"
situation?


530
00:24:36.822 --> 00:24:39.738
Right now it's more of
a bring it on situation.


531
00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:41.236
Charlie's sister is not a fan.

532
00:24:41.237 --> 00:24:42.905
Oh, damn.

533
00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:44.324
Make sure you stretch.

534
00:24:51.287 --> 00:24:52.746
You've been avoiding me.

535
00:24:55.073 --> 00:24:56.492
Uh...

536
00:24:58.031 --> 00:24:59.949
You like darts?

537
00:25:01.577 --> 00:25:03.404
They don't play darts
at Stanford.


538
00:25:03.405 --> 00:25:04.653
You've done your research.

539
00:25:04.654 --> 00:25:05.783
OK.

540
00:25:05.784 --> 00:25:07.280
I'll tell you what.

541
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:09.078
I'll play darts,
and you can ask me


542
00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:10.737
whatever you couldn't
find on the internet.


543
00:25:10.738 --> 00:25:13.655
Great.

544
00:25:15.493 --> 00:25:18.159
So did you grow up in
Washington State or DC?


545
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.448
Both.

546
00:25:19.449 --> 00:25:21.036
Moved to DC when I was 12.

547
00:25:21.037 --> 00:25:22.535
It was awful.

548
00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:24.153
Moving into a big mansion?

549
00:25:24.154 --> 00:25:25.822
I bet.

550
00:25:25.823 --> 00:25:27.030
What do you do for work?

551
00:25:27.031 --> 00:25:28.659
Logistics data analyst.

552
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.859
Uh-huh.

553
00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:32.785
Any hobbies?

554
00:25:32.786 --> 00:25:36.491
Honestly,
I don't really have any.


555
00:25:36.492 --> 00:25:38.199
I work a lot.

556
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.197
Analyzing logistics.

557
00:25:40.198 --> 00:25:42.366
- Right.
- Right.


558
00:25:44.284 --> 00:25:47.370
Do you mind me asking when
was your last relationship?


559
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:49.369
Ended the day I met Charlie.

560
00:25:54.114 --> 00:25:56.491
Listen, I get it.

561
00:25:56.492 --> 00:25:58.079
You're protective
of your brother


562
00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.948
after a blindside heartbreak

563
00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:02.866
and the subsequent hook up
that screams rebound.


564
00:26:05.953 --> 00:26:08.030
I'm protective
of my brother too.


565
00:26:11.827 --> 00:26:14.533
But know that I think
Charlie is really special.


566
00:26:14.534 --> 00:26:18.989
And every moment with him is
somehow better than the last.


567
00:26:21.447 --> 00:26:23.744
Also, I may have played
a little darts at Stanford.


568
00:26:23.745 --> 00:26:25.243
Mm-hmm.

569
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.366
OK, Logistics,
how about a rematch?


570
00:26:33.655 --> 00:26:35.453
This time I'll play
right handed.


571
00:26:36.322 --> 00:26:37.871
You're on.

572
00:26:41.787 --> 00:26:45.032
So did I pass the family test?

573
00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:46.782
With flying colors.

574
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.617
I love this,
getting to know them,


575
00:26:50.618 --> 00:26:53.784
seeing what you do for a living,

576
00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:58.280
getting to know the real
Charlie Nicoletti even more.


577
00:27:01.827 --> 00:27:03.655
Get home safe.

578
00:27:11.367 --> 00:27:12.906
Jonesy.

579
00:27:15.203 --> 00:27:17.070
What are you doing here?

580
00:27:17.071 --> 00:27:18.529
I feel like it's Christmas Eve,

581
00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.077
but I'm the only kid who
knows that Santa is coming,


582
00:27:20.078 --> 00:27:21.366
you know?

583
00:27:21.367 --> 00:27:22.695
Hey, how much do
you think we can


584
00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:24.403
bump the price up to tomorrow?

585
00:27:24.404 --> 00:27:25.493
1.5?

586
00:27:25.494 --> 00:27:26.871
Oh, no.

587
00:27:26.872 --> 00:27:29.698
Come on, maybe

588
00:27:29.699 --> 00:27:31.036
You know, your idea of
tying the price of the horse


589
00:27:31.037 --> 00:27:33.784
to the odds was a genius.

590
00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:36.990
Yeah, well, you did
the heavy lifting.


591
00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:40.487
We're just here to
collect our cut.


592
00:27:40.488 --> 00:27:42.195
I've pulled off some
fun ones over the years.


593
00:27:42.196 --> 00:27:43.325
You know that.

594
00:27:43.326 --> 00:27:46.492
But Martha is my masterpiece.

595
00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:52.325
Don't know how you do it...

596
00:27:52.326 --> 00:27:53.953
Lying to someone
who says she loves you.


597
00:27:53.954 --> 00:27:56.571
I don't think
I could pull that off.


598
00:27:56.572 --> 00:27:58.489
Oh, come on, Charlie.

599
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.075
Love is the oldest con around.

600
00:28:02.076 --> 00:28:04.034
You'd know that
better than anyone.


601
00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:30.167
All right, this is it.

602
00:28:30.168 --> 00:28:31.982
We've got a few hours before
Martha arrives to pump


603
00:28:31.984 --> 00:28:33.482
up the odds on our horse.

604
00:28:33.484 --> 00:28:36.570
The more people we influence
to bet on Wicked Swift,


605
00:28:36.572 --> 00:28:38.988
the more money we all get.

606
00:28:38.989 --> 00:28:41.566

607
00:28:41.567 --> 00:28:42.944

608
00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:45.901
Just got 10,000 Twitter
bots for $1,000 bucks.


609
00:28:45.902 --> 00:28:47.650
It's getting cheaper every year.

610
00:28:47.651 --> 00:28:49.068
That's not exactly comforting.

611
00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:50.487
Right?

612
00:28:50.488 --> 00:28:52.696
Fly, bots, fly!

613
00:28:55.063 --> 00:28:57.859
I know I said 12 to 1.

614
00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.237
But now that I've seen
Wicked Swift with my own eyes,


615
00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:02.775
I don't want anyone giving
clients better than 8 to 1, OK?


616
00:29:02.776 --> 00:29:04.563
8 to 1.

617
00:29:04.564 --> 00:29:06.071
If anyone wants better
odds on Wicked Swift,


618
00:29:06.072 --> 00:29:07.320
they're gonna have to
come to the track


619
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.739
and lay a bet themselves.

Switch all my parlays

623
00:29:16.022 --> 00:29:17.939
I've heard her name
way too many times


624
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.568
for this not to be something.

625
00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:21.026
I'm not missing out on this one.

626
00:29:31.197 --> 00:29:32.565
Ha!

627
00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:33.813
Paul Newman Daytona?

628
00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:36.820
Shut the front door.

629
00:29:36.821 --> 00:29:38.359
Fellow connoisseur, huh?

630
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.776
If you held on to that
through the '87 market crash,


631
00:29:40.777 --> 00:29:43.104
you must be one
hell of a trader.


632
00:29:43.105 --> 00:29:44.693
Am I that obvious?

633
00:29:44.694 --> 00:29:47.320
Nah, I just know
how to spot a winner.


634
00:29:57.071 --> 00:29:59.108
Welcome back to Baltimore Downs.

635
00:29:59.109 --> 00:30:02.695
It is now ten minutes
before the final race.


636
00:30:02.696 --> 00:30:05.482
All right, one last step.

637
00:30:05.483 --> 00:30:08.649
I need you to slip me his
cell phone for 30 seconds.


638
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.856
I will switch account numbers
in the Escrow app


639
00:30:10.857 --> 00:30:12.566
so that no money comes from you.

640
00:30:13.735 --> 00:30:15.692
And his money goes to us.

641
00:30:15.693 --> 00:30:18.279
This is just money for you,
but it's my life.


642
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.277
OK?

643
00:30:20.278 --> 00:30:23.154
No one has ever made me
feel the way he has.


644
00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:25.272
It can't all be a lie.

645
00:30:25.273 --> 00:30:27.779
Martha, that's exactly
how he wants you to feel.


646
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.359
- I just...
- Hey, babe.


647
00:30:30.318 --> 00:30:31.735
Are you ready to
be a horse owner?


648
00:30:31.736 --> 00:30:33.734
Hey, yeah.

649
00:30:35.193 --> 00:30:37.360
You know what, Frankie,
I was thinking,


650
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:40.277
what if instead of a horse,

651
00:30:40.278 --> 00:30:42.904
we use this money
to travel the world?


652
00:30:42.905 --> 00:30:46.111
Yeah? I'll take some
time off starting now.


653
00:30:46.112 --> 00:30:50.277
We can do villas and castles,
overwater bungalows,


654
00:30:50.278 --> 00:30:52.486
any of it, all of it.

655
00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:54.554
That sounds incredible.

656
00:30:55.942 --> 00:30:57.779
I just really want us
to be together.


657
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.568
That's all that matters to me.

658
00:31:02.156 --> 00:31:06.521
It's just, I...
I really want this horse.


659
00:31:06.522 --> 00:31:09.738
You know, it's a once in
a lifetime opportunity.


660
00:31:14.404 --> 00:31:16.271
Of course.

661
00:31:16.272 --> 00:31:18.399
I'm so stupid.
What was I thinking?


662
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.735
No, it's... you know, let's
take a photo to celebrate.


663
00:31:21.736 --> 00:31:23.773
- Sure.
- Oh, shoot.


664
00:31:23.774 --> 00:31:25.272
I forgot my phone in the car.

665
00:31:25.273 --> 00:31:27.110
Can I borrow yours
quickly, honey?


666
00:31:27.111 --> 00:31:28.778
Great.
Thank you so much.


667
00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:30.567
Hey, Amber, would you mind?

668
00:31:30.568 --> 00:31:31.985
Of course.

669
00:31:31.986 --> 00:31:34.313
- Let's burn the prick.
- Yes, ma'am.


670
00:31:34.314 --> 00:31:35.731
Here we go.

671
00:31:35.732 --> 00:31:38.109
Oh, thank you.

672
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.737
All right.

673
00:31:39.738 --> 00:31:42.944
Oh, look at you two.

674
00:31:42.945 --> 00:31:44.942
That's beautiful.

675
00:31:44.943 --> 00:31:47.320
Oh, is that... oh, I
think I might have missed...


676
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:49.438
- Oh, did I delete it?
- No, no.


677
00:31:49.439 --> 00:31:50.856
No, you just closed
the app, that's all.


678
00:31:50.857 --> 00:31:52.105
See?
Here you go.


679
00:31:52.106 --> 00:31:54.772
Great.
Oh, wow.


680
00:31:54.773 --> 00:31:56.730
- Wow.
- Look how happy you look.


681
00:31:56.731 --> 00:31:58.279
Well, that's because I am.

682
00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.319
Congratulations.

683
00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:00.318
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.


684
00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:01.607
Thank you.

685
00:32:03.275 --> 00:32:04.523
It's a process
known as high rose.


686
00:32:04.524 --> 00:32:07.899
Am I in the right house?

687
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.108
I sent the staff home early.

688
00:32:09.109 --> 00:32:11.396
It has been a crazy
couple of days.


689
00:32:11.397 --> 00:32:13.653
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.


690
00:32:13.654 --> 00:32:15.522
Oh, please no.

691
00:32:15.523 --> 00:32:17.400
I don't think I can hear
the word race anymore today.


692
00:32:17.401 --> 00:32:18.778
Come on.
It's that big one.


693
00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:20.646
Remember we went
one year, honey,


694
00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:22.565
with that big media tycoon.

695
00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:24.443
You two at the Derby?

696
00:32:24.444 --> 00:32:26.690
Yes.
And I was pregnant with David.


697
00:32:26.691 --> 00:32:28.569
Oh, yeah.

698
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.527
We weren't telling anyone yet,
and we didn't want to offend


699
00:32:30.528 --> 00:32:31.945
the media guy,
so you were secretly


700
00:32:31.946 --> 00:32:33.813
passing all your drinks to me.

701
00:32:33.814 --> 00:32:35.941
That was the most
drunk you've ever been.


702
00:32:35.942 --> 00:32:37.320
Well, that you know of.

703
00:32:37.321 --> 00:32:38.899
Wow.

704
00:32:43.445 --> 00:32:46.521
OK, don't look now, but the
Hill family is drinking beer,


705
00:32:46.522 --> 00:32:48.858
eating leftover pizza,
and watching a sporting event


706
00:32:48.859 --> 00:32:50.317
like a normal family.

707
00:32:50.318 --> 00:32:51.905
We're a normal family.

708
00:32:51.906 --> 00:32:54.023
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt.


709
00:32:54.024 --> 00:32:55.363
David?

710
00:33:00.647 --> 00:33:03.773
- Hey.
- I've got some bad news.


711
00:33:03.774 --> 00:33:05.093
The party's pulling
their support.


712
00:33:06.232 --> 00:33:09.398
- Without them in our corner...
- Yeah.


713
00:33:09.399 --> 00:33:10.777
The campaign's dead.

714
00:33:14.653 --> 00:33:17.150
Let's keep this
between us for now.


715
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:20.197
We'll regroup tomorrow and...

716
00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:22.905
decide on a plan
in the first light of day.


717
00:33:47.281 --> 00:33:49.567
If you can do it in your
underwear, it's not a job.


718
00:33:49.568 --> 00:33:50.607
That ain't work.

719
00:33:50.608 --> 00:33:52.445
No.

720
00:33:52.446 --> 00:33:54.153
These kids today,
they'll never have


721
00:33:54.154 --> 00:33:56.022
to go through what we did.

722
00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.987
Oh, Nellie.

723
00:33:59.988 --> 00:34:02.156
You're eyeing a big bet, huh?

724
00:34:04.114 --> 00:34:06.730
Well, don't hold out on me!

725
00:34:06.731 --> 00:34:08.149
After all the stock tips
I doled out?


726
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.526
I'm just a humble
owner of a dive bar.


727
00:34:10.527 --> 00:34:11.985
50K is a lot of money for me.

728
00:34:11.986 --> 00:34:14.562
But that's how sure I am
that I'll walk out of here


729
00:34:14.563 --> 00:34:17.230
tonight with six times that.

730
00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:18.738
Well, whatever it is, I'm in.

731
00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:20.447
- I'll go 50K too.
- Ooh hoo hoo!


732
00:34:20.448 --> 00:34:22.106
Hell, 100K!

733
00:34:24.024 --> 00:34:26.481
50,000 on Wicked Swift.

734
00:34:26.482 --> 00:34:29.857
100,000 on Wicked Swift.

735
00:34:29.858 --> 00:34:31.446
1,000 on Wicked Swift.

736
00:34:31.447 --> 00:34:33.025
500 for Wicked Swift, please.

737
00:34:45.793 --> 00:34:47.649
Where the hell have you been?

738
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.447
Whisper campaign
worked too well.


739
00:34:50.448 --> 00:34:51.606
There was a blast
of live bets, which


740
00:34:51.607 --> 00:34:53.563
caused a surge of online bets.

741
00:34:53.564 --> 00:34:55.571
Odds closed past Martha's cap.

742
00:34:55.572 --> 00:34:56.611
No way, really?

743
00:34:56.612 --> 00:34:58.980
4 to 1.
That's 2.5 mil.


744
00:34:58.982 --> 00:35:00.567
Can't she just kick
in a little extra?


745
00:35:00.568 --> 00:35:01.985
Are you kidding me?

746
00:35:01.986 --> 00:35:02.985
She's a stickler
for negotiations.


747
00:35:02.986 --> 00:35:05.023
That's her whole job.

748
00:35:06.611 --> 00:35:08.069
Hold on.

749
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.986
Let him set the hook first.

750
00:35:10.987 --> 00:35:12.484
Right now Jones
is panicking, which


751
00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:14.313
is exactly what the con is
designed to get him to do,


752
00:35:14.314 --> 00:35:16.401
to think irrationally.

753
00:35:16.402 --> 00:35:17.610
And now...

754
00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.147
Hey, how about this?

755
00:35:20.148 --> 00:35:22.774
You put in your own money,
make up the difference.


756
00:35:22.775 --> 00:35:24.403
A half mil?

757
00:35:24.404 --> 00:35:25.691
That's a hell of a convincer.

758
00:35:25.692 --> 00:35:27.939
Think of it like
a ten-minute loan.


759
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.188
I mean, it's your money.

760
00:35:29.189 --> 00:35:31.197
It's ours.

761
00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.488
Shall we?

762
00:35:42.985 --> 00:35:44.653
All right, we're ready.

763
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.856
First time I ever sold
a horse on my phone.


764
00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:53.154
There really is an app
for everything.


765
00:35:53.155 --> 00:35:54.522
So what's the price?

766
00:35:54.523 --> 00:35:56.480
It's 2.5.

767
00:35:56.481 --> 00:35:58.608
But don't worry,
I'm covering the difference


768
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:59.778
from my savings.

769
00:35:59.779 --> 00:36:01.855
I already put
my account info in.


770
00:36:01.856 --> 00:36:04.562
All right, rolling.
Everyone?


771
00:36:04.563 --> 00:36:05.981
Go ahead and eSign the app.

772
00:36:05.982 --> 00:36:07.439
Yes I do.

773
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.446
And I just did.

774
00:36:10.447 --> 00:36:12.654
Well, congratulations, everyone.

775
00:36:12.655 --> 00:36:14.113
Let me get some
glasses for everybody.


776
00:36:14.114 --> 00:36:15.651
Congratulations.

777
00:36:15.652 --> 00:36:17.529
Just gonna get
a better view of my new horse


778
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.729
- before the big race.
- Yeah.


779
00:36:34.483 --> 00:36:37.031
- There they go.
- Away from the gate...


780
00:36:44.194 --> 00:36:45.572
Airport.

781
00:36:51.946 --> 00:36:56.022
Congratulations,
Misty Queen on second...


782
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.776
When do you think
Jonesy will figure it out?


783
00:37:10.777 --> 00:37:12.195
Probably about the same time
he lands


784
00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:14.314
wherever it is he's going.

785
00:37:16.112 --> 00:37:18.398
Hey, do you want to
know how our horse did?


786
00:37:18.399 --> 00:37:19.857
You don't have to tell me.

787
00:37:19.858 --> 00:37:21.945
I know a sixth place horse
when I see one.


788
00:37:21.946 --> 00:37:23.813
Come on.

789
00:37:40.397 --> 00:37:42.354
Hey, Mom?

790
00:37:42.355 --> 00:37:44.223
Mom, wake up!

791
00:37:44.224 --> 00:37:46.560
Where the hell is Ollie?

792
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:48.197
She's here.

793
00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:49.947
She's... she's right there.

794
00:38:17.021 --> 00:38:18.808
Hey.

795
00:38:18.809 --> 00:38:20.266
Uh, thanks to your
niece's petulance,


796
00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:21.895
we know what
Daphne's been up to.


797
00:38:21.896 --> 00:38:23.643
I'm sorry, you lost me.

798
00:38:23.644 --> 00:38:25.442
Ollie slipped her tracker
into Daphne's purse.


799
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.098
What?

800
00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:30.476
Let's compare it
to Daphne's notebook.


801
00:38:30.477 --> 00:38:31.476
Wait.

802
00:38:31.477 --> 00:38:33.014
Mm-hmm.

803
00:38:33.015 --> 00:38:35.022
OK, hey, where was she
at 8:00 p. M. Last night?


804
00:38:35.023 --> 00:38:36.520
Ellicott City.

805
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:40.097
OK, where was
she 3:00 p. M. Today?


806
00:38:40.098 --> 00:38:43.104
Pikesville.

807
00:38:43.105 --> 00:38:45.721
That's... that's Russian and
Taiwanese cartel territory.


808
00:38:45.722 --> 00:38:48.099
So why would Daphne be
meeting with rival cartels?


809
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.187
I don't think meeting
with rival cartels


810
00:38:50.188 --> 00:38:51.855
is part of Connor's MO.

811
00:38:51.856 --> 00:38:53.683
So maybe Connor doesn't
know what she's up to.


812
00:38:53.684 --> 00:38:55.981
So our secret
daughter thinks she's


813
00:38:55.982 --> 00:38:59.477
the one calling the shots
for the Maguire empire.


814
00:38:59.478 --> 00:39:02.015
You know it'd be a real
shame if that got out.


815
00:39:02.016 --> 00:39:03.603
Huh.

816
00:39:03.604 --> 00:39:04.932
Right.

817
00:39:04.933 --> 00:39:06.431
All right.

818
00:39:17.101 --> 00:39:19.437
Who's this?

819
00:39:19.438 --> 00:39:21.265
Someone with mutual interests.

820
00:39:21.266 --> 00:39:22.934
Did you know that Daphne
Finch is making moves


821
00:39:22.935 --> 00:39:24.932
with your rivals over here?

822
00:39:24.933 --> 00:39:26.350
What the hell are
you going on about?


823
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:30.147
Russians, Dominicans,
Taiwanese triads...


824
00:39:30.148 --> 00:39:32.724
All groups who sell
the same product as you,


825
00:39:32.725 --> 00:39:35.062
and all groups
that she has met with.


826
00:39:35.063 --> 00:39:37.100
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that your sister's


827
00:39:37.101 --> 00:39:38.388
taking a run at your crown.

828
00:39:38.389 --> 00:39:42.056
See, I don't have a sister.

829
00:39:45.272 --> 00:39:48.689
You sure about that?

830
00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:53.474
Who'd you say you are?

831
00:39:54.933 --> 00:39:57.350
I didn't.

832
00:40:06.811 --> 00:40:08.099
What'd you find?

833
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.597
Another massive deposit was just

834
00:40:09.598 --> 00:40:10.767
made from the
Maguire U. S. Account


835
00:40:10.768 --> 00:40:13.563
into the Maguire
Ireland account.


836
00:40:13.564 --> 00:40:15.351
How can Daphne make
such a big payment


837
00:40:15.352 --> 00:40:18.268
if she's selling their product
at bargain basement prices?


838
00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:19.807
She's not selling
off to get out.


839
00:40:19.808 --> 00:40:21.895
She's currying favor
with rivals,


840
00:40:21.896 --> 00:40:25.351
which means she's building
something even bigger.


841
00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:26.730
But if she's still making
payments to Ireland,


842
00:40:26.731 --> 00:40:29.098
that means she's found
a new revenue stream.


843
00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:30.896
If we find that...

844
00:40:30.897 --> 00:40:31.936
We can tear it down
whatever fresh hell


845
00:40:31.937 --> 00:40:33.853
she's trying to build.

846
00:40:33.854 --> 00:40:35.641
Let's follow the money.

847
00:40:35.642 --> 00:40:37.769
Hill, Cass wants to
see you in his office.


848
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.478
Thanks.

849
00:40:41.017 --> 00:40:42.604
Jones, what happened?

850
00:40:42.605 --> 00:40:44.432
I don't know how, but
our sneaky ass accountants


851
00:40:44.433 --> 00:40:46.061
got to the money
before the transfer.


852
00:40:46.062 --> 00:40:47.889
Got mine too.

853
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.267
Obviously, I can't give you a
cut of something I don't have.


854
00:40:49.268 --> 00:40:50.976
So hold on,
let me get this straight.


855
00:40:50.977 --> 00:40:53.603
We stick our necks out,
and you're gonna stiff us.


856
00:40:53.604 --> 00:40:55.431
Dude, I'm out

857
00:40:55.432 --> 00:40:56.810
I'll get you on the next one.

858
00:40:56.811 --> 00:40:58.639
Yeah, hey, you know what?
Don't bother, pal.


859
00:41:01.057 --> 00:41:03.474
Con men never see it coming.

860
00:41:04.523 --> 00:41:06.430
I hope Martha is OK.

861
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:08.348
I'm sure
she's better than Jonesy.


862
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:09.897
Maybe.

863
00:41:09.898 --> 00:41:12.354
It's gotta hurt, having
somebody lie to you like that.


864
00:41:12.355 --> 00:41:14.602
I mean, you've been there.

865
00:41:14.603 --> 00:41:16.770
You know.

866
00:41:16.771 --> 00:41:18.099
Yeah.

867
00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:24.013
And I'll call you back ASAP.

868
00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:25.431
Hey, Em.

869
00:41:25.432 --> 00:41:27.389
Trying to track you down.

870
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.978
Wanna talk about something.

871
00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:30.620
OK, call me back.
